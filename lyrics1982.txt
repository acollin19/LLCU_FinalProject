Physical Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm sayin' all the things that I know you'll like
Makin' good conversation
I gotta handle you just right
You know what I mean
I took you to an intimate restaurant
Then to a suggestive movie
There's nothin' left to talk about
Unless it's horizontally

[Chorus]
Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical
Let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk
Let's get physical, physical
I wanna get physical
Let's get into physical
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk
Let me hear your body talk

[Verse 2]
I've been patient, I've been good
Tried to keep my hands on the table
It's gettin' hard, this holdin' back
You know what I mean
I'm sure you'll understand my point of view
We know each other mentally
You gotta know that you're bringin' out
The animal in me

TranslationsPortuguêsEye of the Tiger Lyrics[Verse 1]
Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

[Verse 2]
Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all

Centerfold Lyrics[Intro]
Come on!

[Verse 1]
Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Years go by
I'm looking through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

[Chorus]
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that négligée
Is really just too much

[Chorus]
My blood runs cold (Yeah)
My memory has just been sold

It's okay, I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

[Pre-Chorus 3]
A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

Don’t You Want Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Philip Oakey]
You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

[Pre-Chorus: Philip]
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me
It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

[Chorus: Philip]
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?

[Verse 2: Susan Ann Sulley]
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez

Dribble off those Bobby Brooks slacks, now do what I please"

Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
"Well then, there Diane, we ought to run off to the city"

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love

Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away

You give me somethin' I can hold on to

Key Largo Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wrapped around each other, trying so hard to stay warm
That first cold winter together, lying in each other's arms
Watching those old movies, falling in love so desperately
Honey I was your hero, and you were my leading lady

[Chorus]
We had it all
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our own late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you, kid
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know
Just like they did in Key Largo
Ooo-ooo
[Verse 2]
Honey, can't you remember? We played all the parts
That sweet scene of surrender, when you gave me your heart
Please say you will, play it again
'Cause I love you still, baby this can't be the end

[Chorus]
We had it all (we had it all)
Just like Bogie and Bacall
Starring in our old late, late show
Sailing away to Key Largo
Here's lookin' at you, kid (here's lookin' at you, kid)
Missing all the things we did
We can find it once again, I know

Waiting for a Girl Like You Lyrics[Verse 1]
So long
I've been lookin' too hard, I've been waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know what I will find
I only know it's a matter of time

[Pre-Chorus]
When you love someone
When you love someone
It feels so right, so warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too
Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me if I'm comin' on too strong?
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I want to be sure

I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come into my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you

To come into my life

You're so good
When we make love it's understood
It's more than a touch or a word we say
Only in dreams could it be this way

[Pre-Chorus]
When you love someone
Yeah, really love someone
Now, I know it's right
From the moment I wake up 'til deep in the night
There's no where on earth that I'd rather be
Than holding you tenderly

Don’t Talk to Strangers LyricsWhen you were just a young girl and still in school
How come you never learned the golden rule?
Don't talk to strange men, don't be a fool
I'm hearing stories; I don't think that's cool

Why dont'cha tell me someone isn't lovin' you?
'Cause you're my girl, some say it's no longer true
You're seeing some slick continental dude
I'm beggin' you, please

You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk

Nobody, nobody ever told you
Now tell me, how's life in the big city?
I hear the competition's tough; baby, that's a pity
And every man's an actor; every girl is pretty
I don't like what's gettin' back to me

Now, who's this Don Juan I've been hearing of?
Love hurts when only one's in love
Now, did ya fall at first sight or did you need a shove?
I'm beggin' you, please

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up

The Sweetest Thing (I’ve Ever Known) Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I see you in the morning
That old sleep still in your eyes
I remember all the laughter
And the tears we shared last night

[PreChorus 1]
And as we lie here, just two shadows
In the light before the dawn
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you
[Chorus]
And I have never been afraid of losing
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

[Verse 2]
Now, you and I, we're not children
We have both been loved before
We have given and we have taken
Many rides on troubled shores

[PreChorus 2]
And all the heartaches and temptations
Only make me love you more
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you

My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind
Oh, shucks

I'm just an average guy
I fooled around a little on the side
Never thought it would amount to much
Never met a girl whose love was so tough
Who'd thought a one-night stand
Would turn into such a hot romance?
Mmmm, when she did it to me
I slipped and fell in love
I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind.  Mmmm

Now I know the rules of the game
You hit it once, then break away clean
I should've never gone back, I know
But I had to have just a little bit more
My friends laugh, but that's alright
I may be a fool, but I know what I like
Now I hate to have to cheat
But it feels better when I sneak.  Ow!

I'm in love (I'm in love)

Somebody help me

Sweet Dreams LyricsThis is the time when you need a friend
You just need someone near
I'm not looking forward to the night
I'll spend thinking of you when you're not here

How many times will I think about the things
I'd like to do?
Always denied the right to live my life the way
I want, I want to share it with you

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams
I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by
And I'll write the words you love
But what I can't say in a letter
Will just have to wait till I get home

There's not much time to tell you
Half the things that I should
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
And I'd do it again if I could

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes

Close your eyes

We smiled without any style
We kiss altogether wrong

We lived without each other thinking

Without me and you

Only the lonely can play

Who Can It Be Now? Lyrics[Intro]

Who can it be knocking at my door?
Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired, and I'm not feeling right
All I wish is to be alone;
Stay away, don't you invade my home
Best off if you hang outside
Don't come in, I'll only run and hide

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

[Verse 2]
Who can it be knocking at my door?
Make no sound, tip-toe across the floor
If he hears, he'll knock all day
I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay
I've done no harm, I keep to myself;
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
I like it here with my childhood friend;
Here they come, those feelings again!

Eye in the Sky Lyrics[Verse 1]
Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But I ain't gonna give anymore
Don't ask me
That's how it goes
'Cause part of me knows what you're thinking

[Verse 2]
Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take any more
Believe me
The sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing
[Chorus]
I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see any more to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind

[Verse 3]
Don't leave false illusion behind
Don't cry, I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving

[Chorus]
I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)

Open Arms Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lying beside you
Here in the dark
Feeling your heartbeat with mine
Softly you whisper
You're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?

[Pre-Chorus]
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are
By my side
[Chorus]
So now I come to you
With open arms
Nothing to hide
Believe what I say
So here I am
With open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

[Verse 2]
Living without you
Living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

[Pre-Chorus]
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

Leader of the Band Lyrics[Verse 1]
An only child, alone and wild; a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay
A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline - a thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

[Chorus]
The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
[Verse 2]
My brothers' lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

[Verse 3]
I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And, Papa, I don't think I said 'I love you' near enough

[Chorus]
The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

Leather and Lace Lyrics[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks]
Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow?
Shatter with words, impossible to follow
You're saying I'm fragile, try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still, I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
[Chorus: Stevie Nicks]
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me?
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never wanna leave

[Verse 4: Don Henley]
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by

Even the Nights Are Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
I, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong
Why love had gone
And left me lonely
I, I was so confused
Feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me
And my loneliness left me

[Verse 2]
I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak
But now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you
[Verse 3]
You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see
That you feel the same way

[Chorus]
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together

Since I found you, oh

I’ve Never Been To Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, lady, you, lady
Cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about
The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

[Verse 2]
Ooo, I've been to Georgia
And California
And anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free
[Chorus]
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

[Verse 3]
Please lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part
Of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives

[Verse 4]
Oh, I've been to Nice
And the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things
That a woman ain't supposed to see

[Chorus]
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

[Verse 6]
Sometimes I've been to crying
For unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet
I've spent my life exploring
The subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free

Hey lady, I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me
I've been to paradise
Never been to me

Heat of the Moment Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

[Verse 2]
Do you remember when we used to dance?
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung
[Chorus]
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

[Verse 3]
And now you find yourself in Eighty Two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

[Chorus]
'Cause it's the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambitions you remember well

We wandered through the days like they had no end
But now that you are gone I'm under cover
I just can't think about you as a friend

Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know

It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me
So now I'll go the minstrel road without
I know there will be times when I need you there
And each night as I sing those songs about you
I'll think back to the time when you used to care

One more chance will you, take chance?

Gonna eat the cherries up and take them all for a ride

Now I've got them on the run, and I'm looking for the high score;

That Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love that you'll leave torn apart
That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
Cause she can please her man
She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long
[Chorus]
Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

[Verse 2]
I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do
That girl, That girl
That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word

And a head full of dreams
He said "Somehow, someway
It's gotta get better than this!"
Patti packed her bags
Left a note for her mama
She was just seventeen
There were tears in her eyes
When she kissed her little sister goodbye
[Verse 2]
They held each other tight
As they drove on through the night
They were so excited!
We got just one shot of life
Let's take it while we're still not afraid
Because life is so brief
And time is a thief when you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand
It can slip right through your hands

[Chorus]
Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let 'em put you down
Don't let 'em push you 'round
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

[Verse 3]
Paradise was closed
So they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
They took a two-room apartment
That was jumping every night of the week
Happiness was found in each other's arms
As expected, yeah
Billy pierced his ears
Drove a pickup like a lunatic, ooh!

Don't let 'em put you down
Don't let 'em push you 'round
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view
Come on, babe!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Young hearts, be free tonight
Time is on, on your side

[Verse 4]
Billy wrote a letter back home
To Patti's parents tryin' to explain
He said: "We're both real sorry
That it had to turn out this way"
But there ain't no point in talking
When there's nobody listening
So we just ran away
Patti gave birth to a ten-pound baby boy, yeah!

[Chorus]
Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side
Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side
[Outro]
Young hearts gotta run free
Be free, live free
Time is on, time is on your side
Time, time, time, time is on your side
Is on your side

Is on your side
Young heart be free tonight

Freeze-Frame Lyrics[Intro]
Freeze-Frame!

[Verse 1]
I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound

[Verse 2]
Thursday morning was a hot-flash factor
Her face still focused in my mind
Test-strip proof-sheet love is hard to find
Friday night we'll dance the spotlight grind
Stop-time heart for me if she's not mine
[Chorus]
(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!
(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!
(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!
(Freeze-Frame! Woo!) Now freeze!

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lookin' at a flashback Sunday
Zoom-lens feelings just won't disappear
Close-up darkroom sweet-talk in my ear
Her hot-spot love for me is strong
This freeze-frame moment can't be wrong

[Chorus]
(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!
(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!
(Freeze-Frame!) Freeze-Frame!
(Freeze-Frame! Woo!) Now freeze!

[Bridge]

It gets rough but there's nowhere to run
This is where we belong
We are strong, we can never give up
If we wanted to we could
But we've always understood
To keep lookin' for the good, oh

Who will keep the fire burnin'?

Do You Believe in Love Lyrics[Verse]
I was walking down a one way street
Just a looking for someone to meet
One woman, who was looking for a man
Now I'm hoping (hoping) that the feeling is right
And I'm wondering (wondering) if you'll stay for the night
So I'm coming (I don't want to be lonely baby please tell me)
I want to love you all over

[Chorus]
Do you believe in love
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe in love
Oh you're making me believe it too
[Verse]
Now the feeling is beginning to grow
And the meaning is something you only know
If you believe it, take my hand and I'll take your heart
Come on
Now I'm wondering (wondering) where does true love begin
I'm going under (under) so I'm letting you in
My woman (I don't want to be lonely baby please tell me)
I want to love you all over

[Chorus]
(Do you believe in love)
Do you believe in love
(Do you believe it's true)
You believe it's true
(Do you believe in love)
Oh you're making me believe it too

I'm so glad it's changed

Cool Night Lyrics[Verse 1]
I sometimes wonder why all the flowers have to die
I dream about you and now summer's come and gone
And the nights they seem so long
Come on over tonight, come on over

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right, you can go
Oh, when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old
[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't talk about the past
How love's supposed to last forever
And you, don't have to take a stand, lay out any plans
Come on over tonight, come on over

[Chorus]
It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right, you can go
Oh, when the cool night
Brings back memories of a good life
When this love was not so old

Caught Up In You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never knew there'd come a day
When I'd be sayin' to you
"Don't let this good love slip away
Now that we know that it's true."

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't, don't you know the kind of man I am?
No, said I'd never fall in love again
But it's real, and the feeling comes shining through
[Chorus 1]
I'm so caught up in you, little girl
And I never did suspect a thing
So caught up in you, little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby, it's true, you're the one
Who caught me, baby, you taught me
How good it could be

[Verse 2]
It took so long to change my mind
I thought that love was a game
I played around enough to find
No two are ever the same

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You made me realize the love I missed
So hot, love I couldn't quite resist
When it's right, the light just comes shining through

[Chorus 1]
I'm so caught up in you, little girl
You're the one that's got me down on my knees
So caught up in you, little girl
That I never wanna get myself free
And baby, it's true, you're the one

Why Do Fools Fall in Love? LyricsOoh-wah
Ooh-wah
Ooh-wah
Ooh-wah
Ooh-wah
Ooh-wah

Why do fools fall in love?

Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of the day?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
Love is a losing game
And love can be a shame
I know of a fool, you see
For that fool is me

Tell me why?
Tell me why?

Why do birds sing so gay?
And lovers await the break of the day?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?

Why does my heart skip a crazy beat?
For I know
It will reach defeat

Tell me why?
Tell me why?

Why do fools fall in love?

Tell me why?

Love In The First Degree Lyrics[Verse 1]
I once though of love as a prison
A place I didn't want to be
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free
But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time
I never thought that I would get caught
It seemed like a perfect crime

[Chorus]
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree
[Verse 2]
I thought it would be so simple
Like a thousand times before
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door
Now, babe I'm not begging for mercy
Go ahead and throw the book at me
If loving you's a crime
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be

[Chorus]
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree

Wasted on the Way Lyrics[Verse 1]
Look around me
I can see my life before me
Running rings around the way it used to be
I am older now
I have more than what I wanted
But I wish that I had started
Long before I did

[Chorus]
And there's so much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
[Strings Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Oh, when you were young
Did you question all the answers?
Did you envy all the dancers
Who had all the nerve?
Look round you now
You must go for what you wanted
Look at all my friends who did and got what they deserved

[Chorus]
So much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
So much love to make up
Everywhere you turn
Love we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away

Think I’m in Love LyricsOoh
Something's got a hold on me now
It's a feelin', burnin' like a love on fire
Hold me tight baby
Don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's looking up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
It surrounds me
Moving like a sea of madness
It controls me
Makes me do all the things I do for you
Blow my mind, babe
Thinkin' about you now
And I don't know if I'll make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's looking up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

Baby, how you do it
There must be something to it
Babe now it's gotta be love
The magic's in your hand
You made me understand
I know, I know it's gotta be love

It's gotta be love

Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've hung around with big shots
Never knew love was in the sights
I guess I missed the target
Caught up in a different line of fire

But I know
Since I've been aiming
For the sweetness in your soul
Your name is on the bullet
And it's getting ready to explode
There's been a change inside my life
And I just wanna let you know

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't letting go

Girl, you better load your gun up right
She said you
You gotta come out smoking
Hit it with your best shot
Every time

Well, I didn't understand her
Til you walked right into range
I saw your love at twenty paces
And I knew I'd won the game

One Hundred Ways Lyrics[Verse 1: James Ingram]
Compliment what she does
Send her roses just because
If it's violins she loves
Let them play

Dedicate her favorite song
And hold her closer
All night long
Love her today
Find one hundred ways
[Verse 2: James Ingram]
Don't forget there could be
An old lover in her memory
If you need her so much more
Why don't you say

Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay
Find one hundred ways

[Bridge: James Ingram]
Bein' cool won't help
You keep a love warm
You'll just blow your chance
Take the time to open up your heart
That's the secret of romance

[Verse 3: James Ingram]
Sacrifice if you care
Buy her some moonlight to wear
If there's one more star she wants
Go all the way

In your arms tonight
She'll reflect
That she owes you the sweetest of debts

Our Lips Are Sealed Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can you hear them?
They talk about us
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise
Can you see them?
See right through them
They have no shield
No secrets to reveal

In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed

That we must use
In our defense
Silence

Look right through them
That's when they'll disappear
That's when we'll be feared

You Could Have Been with Me LyricsYou're the seventh son of the seventh son
Maybe that's why you're such a strange and special one
You can't even seem to love yourself
And with a few exceptions, not anybody else

You can lead a horse to water
But you cannot make him drink
You can give a man your whole heart and soul
But you cannot make him think

You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely
You can tell him the date of departure
Exactly the place and the time
He might really wanna be there
But he misses every time
Is he a man or a paper tiger
When you need him will he run or stand beside you

You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely
You could have been with me instead of alone and lonely

You Can Do Magic Lyrics[Verse 1]
I never believed in things that I couldn't see
I said if I can't feel it then how could it be?
No, no magic could happen to me
And then I saw you, I couldn't believe it
You took my heart, I couldn't retrieve it
Said to myself, "What's it all about?"
Now I know there can be no doubt

You can do magic, you can have anything that you desire

Did It in a Minute Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you find yourself alone
And when going out is coming home
Well, you can count on the kid
'Cause there's nobody waiting around, oh, oh
If you're not an easy mark
It's a shot in the dark that hits the heart
And I know, I know, I know, I know when it's coming
I thought so anyway

And some are due for change

Well, I still can't say I know
When a love is real or touch-and-go
And if two can be one
Who is the one two becomes, oh, oh
Am I quick enough to see
When I'm ready and it's right for me?
I say, I say, I say, I say that I want it
I think so anyway

Everybody always laughs at love
But what they want is to be proven wrong
Then you came along

I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotise me through
Hypnotise me through

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day

A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Appearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you

Comin’ in and Out of Your Life LyricsI still can remember
The last time I cried
I was holding you and loving you
Knowing it would end

I never felt so good
Yet felt so bad
You're the one I love
And what makes it sad
Is you don't belong to me
And I can remember
The last time I lied
I was holding you and telling you
We could still be friends

Tried to let you go
But I can't, you know
And even though I'm not with you
I need you so
But you don't belong to me

Chorus:
Comin' in and out of your life
Isn't easy
When there are so many nights
I can't hold you and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
Comin' in and out of your life
Will never free me
'cause I don't need to touch you
To feel you, it's so real with you

I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time
A stronger love
Just can't be found
Even though at times this crazy world
Is turning up-side-down
You'll always belong to me

What happened here as the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

And what's it for? This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace
[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

[Verse 3]
And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?"

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out?
Can you come out to play?"

Yesterday’s Songs LyricsSaying "I love you"
Just sayin' "I love you"

Yesterday's songs
Don't stay around long
Not much anymore
Yesterday's words
Don't make themselves heard
Like they did before

Baby, yesterday's blues
May be yesterday's news
But the truth always stays the same
And the good things will never change
Like sayin' "I love you"
Just sayin' "I love you"
Yesterday's songs
Don't seem to belong
They're here and they're gone
Yesterday's moves
Don't stay in the grooves
They keep moving on

Maybe yesterday's rhyme
Was for yesterday's time
And the future's not ours to see
But there's some things that always will be
Like sayin' "I love you"
Sayin' "I love you"

Baby, yesterday's blues
May be yesterday's news
But the truth always stays the same
And the good things will never change
Like sayin' "I love you"

Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic Lyrics[Verse 1]
Though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve, as I've done from the start

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on
[Verse 2]
Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

[Bridge]
I resolved to call her up
A thousand times a day
And ask her if she'll marry me
In some old-fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for her goes on

Here I Am (Just When I Thought I Was Over You) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here I am
Playin' with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me

[Verse 2]
Holding you
A feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside
[Pre-Chorus]
So there's no sense pretending
My heart, it's not mending

[Chorus]
Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh baby, those memories come crashin' through
And I just can't go on without you

[Verse 3]
On my own
I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you

[Chorus]
Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own

Any Day Now LyricsAny day now
I will hear you say
Good bye, my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Any day now, I'll be all alone

Any day now
When your restless eyes meets someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life

Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now, when the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
Then my tears will flow

Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now, love will let me down
Cause you won't be around

Oh, then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down
Cause you won't be around
Any day now
You won't be around
No, no, no, no, no, no, you won't be aroundYou might also likeEmbed

But a single touch surely is worth a thousand words

All About It (feat. Pimp C) Lyrics[Verse 1 - Too $hort]
Now who's sleeping on the midwest, better get your head checked
Niggas gonnna feel this, even all the rednecks
Bounce to the beat when they hear this shit
I've been underground damn near 20 years in the mix
I moved down south cuz old man was wild
My lil homie rapping on, came to show you how
To take my skills and keep paying the bills
Fuck what you're saying cuz I'm staying real
The young homies keep me on my toes, still got the old flow
Book me in your town and there'll never be a no-show
Kick it down south where they keeping it crunk
Cuz the niggas down south got they own funk!
You heard about the West Coast, heard about the East Coast
Heard about Miami-base, but what about [?]
Or Kalamazoo, they got MC's too!
If you come around my crew, you gonna have to say a few
Or you can just get your bitch-ass out
You come to me you can play, sing, rap, no doubt
You got to go, what the fuck is this?
Hip-Hop Culture or the music business?
[Chorus - Pimp C]
Bitch, I'm so all about it
I just can't live without it
Bitch, I'm so all about it
I just can't live without it
Nigga I'm so all about it
I just can't live without it
Bitch, I'm so all about it
I just can't live without it
Nigga I'm so...

[Verse 2 - Pimp C + Too $hort]
(Pimp C):
Bitch it's all about the indo weed and stacking money
In this land of milk and honey, ain't a damn thing funny
Let's put this shit together, Too $hort and Pimp-C
Put niggas on the map from Oakland to P.A.T
(Too $hort):
Chicago and Detroit, Houston, Dallas
Support Short records and you can have this
Funk 'till eternity, folks gotta learn to be together
Cuz we all on the same journey
So as I roll, I'ma look out for you
If I see you do it wrong I take my time and show you
How to get it right, make money every night
Gotta use your brain if you wanna win the fight
East coast, West coast, who got the best flow?
Maybe at your next show, niggas oughta test your
Crowd skills, and check your record sales
Then we'll find out how you fake as hell
I said it ain't where you from it's how you do it where you're at
Real players from your town all knew that you was whack
Fake nigga in Cali', fake nigga in New York
Small time, you never be bigger than $hort
Now why you trying to front so hard?
You from a gangster town but you is a punk ass mark
Respect don't come cuz of where you from
Keep it real in your heart from square one
And all you highly influenced followers, on the wrong path
Spitting game to make the motherfucking song last
It's a shame you can't make no cash
Everytime we roll out we gotta wait on your ass
You're just slow, can't be down with nation wide
Cuz we seriously, trying to get the paper right
Talking bout contracts, cash flow, credit cards, mean cars
Signin lot of that for the next 16 bars
Make a hit, get paid, get laid, what you want
Tellin motherfuckers where you getting all that money from

And all the trill niggas riding trues and vogues
And all the bitch niggas trying to buy these hoes
Got a bitch try to chip me on my cellular phone
Smelling like 64-dollar cologne
Nigga got mad cuz his bitch chose me
But you just showed you ain't no real P.I.M.P

Got two freaks from Decateur wanna lick our sacks

Out in Nashville, Tenessee
Bitches in with me for sure
Sipping on the Remy X ho!
With the hoes, last night I did that
Every blue moon I got to pull out my big hat
Do some more shit other niggas can't do
Like hooking up this funky ass nation wide crew
We come from everywhere, working under one roof
Come through, front, somebody might stump you
With a rhyme or a boot
What you finna do?
Getting blood all over my nigga's tennish shoe
You better take my advice and get lost fast
Before them boys from Texas, get off in your ass
And it won't be pretty, if my uncle Frank Middy
Come lookin for you, shooting at you, it gets shitty!
But in your mind you rank higher than me
Put your money in the bank then come wire it to me
Cuz I'll flip it, while you trying to buy a new car
Find me in the studio signing new stars
Take a hundred thousand dollars make a quick million
Start from the floor and go straight to the ceiling
You hiding from reality, nigga you is a bitch
Niggas like me get used to getting rich
Signing autographs, taking pictures of my fans
Hit the town and take your bitch to my place
She get a bigger and better deal, fucking with me
I heard $hort dog ran up in your freak!
She dissapeared, heard she went to Cali!
Jumped on the plane, and flew the bitch to Maui
Or maybe Atlanta, I got your bitch posted
Popping champagne bottles 'bout to get roasted
Chilling at the house, me and four hoes
Jumped in the jacuzzi ain't wearing no clothes

Hot In the City Lyrics[Intro]
(Stranger, stranger, stranger, stranger)

[Verse 1]
It's hot here at night, lonely, black and quiet
On a hot summer night
Don't be afraid of the world we made
On a hot summer night
‘Cause when a long-legged lovely walks by
Yeah, you can see the look in her eye
Then you know that it's
[Chorus]
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
For all the dreams and schemes
People are as they seem
On a hot summer night
Don't be no fun, don't forget you're young
On a hot summer night
A sometime someone you're not
Don't wait to see what you've got
‘Cause you know that you're

[Chorus]
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight (All right)
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight

We'll walk until my feet drop
I'm a train when I'm hateful
Yeah, lay right down now
And ride until your head breaks
I'm a-walkin' 'til my brain pops
I will move with the beat now
I'm a chain ‘round an A-bomb
I'm a ribbon in the heat now

Kids in America Lyrics[Verse 1]
Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Downtown the young ones are going
Downtown the young ones are growing
[Chorus]
We're the kids in America (Woah)
We're the kids in America (Woah)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

[Verse 2]
Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance
Hot-shot (Shot), give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory

Man on Your Mind LyricsI can feel it floating away
Inch by inch
Day by day
Love boat set itself free
Castaway, slipping out to sea

I can feel it coming adrift
Even a blind man could see the rift
From an ocean liner
To a Chinese junk
There ain't been a ship that can't be sunk
I used to dream it could last forever
But pipe dreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never
Thought something like this
Couldn't happen to you

I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

You don't know
Just what you got
Till it's gone
I guess you heard that a lot
But it's true
It's not just a game
You can't change your life
By changing your name

It's not something you can hide away
Sooner or later it starts to show
It's written on your face
You've been betrayed
Do you really believe that I don't know

So it's no use to fight

Let him know you're with me
For the rest of the night

Ooh, I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
(Got a man on your mind)
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say

What’s Forever For Lyrics[Verse 1]
I've been looking at people and how they change with the times
And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds

Maybe it's me who's gone crazy, but I can't understand why
All these lovers keep hurting each other
When good love is so hard to come by

[Chorus]
So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?
[Verse 2]
And I see love hungry people tryin' their best to survive
When right there in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even trying to keep it alive

[Chorus](x2)
So, what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?You might also likeEmbed

Waiting on a Friend Lyrics{Intro}

[Verse 1]
Watching girls go passing by
It ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway
I'm just trying to make some sense'
Out of these girls that passing by
The tales they tell of men
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
[Verse 2]
A smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend

[Verse 3]
Don't need a whore, I don't need no booze
Don't need a virgin priest
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect
Making love and breaking hearts
It is a game for youth
But I'm not waiting on my lady
I'm just waiting on a friend

Goin’ Down LyricsI get the feeling that I'm in way over my head
I should be careful but I'm goin deeper instead
Cause when she looks at me
I wanna run by her side
Anyone could see
A fool could drown in her eyes

And I'm goin down for the last time
I'm goin down for the last time
Goin down, out of my mind
I'm nearly out of my mind
Love is comin over, over me
It must be magic how she casts her spell over me
Her secret passions got me charmed
I'll never get free
Cause when she's holding me
She lights a fire in my soul
Any fool could see

Arthur’s Theme (Best That You Can Do) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way 'cross town
Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?"

[Chorus]
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love
[Verse 2]
Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

[Chorus]
When you get caught between the moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do (The best that you can do)
The best that you can do
Is fall in love

Through the Years Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do

[Chorus]
Through the years, you've never let me down
You turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found
I've found with you... through the years
I've never been afraid, I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed, right here with you
Through the years
[Verse 2]
I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had, I've always been so glad
To be with you ... through the years
It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you
Through the years
Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong, I know that I belonged
Right here with you... through the years
I never had a doubt, we'd always work things out
I've learned what love's about, by loving you
Through the years

Said to my friend, baby (Everything stops)
Nothin' else mattered
He was no more

Than a baby then
Well, he seemed broken hearted
Somethin' within him
But the moment
That I first laid
Eyes on him
All alone on the edge of seventeen
