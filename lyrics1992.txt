End of the Road Lyrics[Intro: Michael McCary]
Girl, you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playin' with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever, baby, you just see

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?
[Pre-Chorus: Wanyá Morris]
When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try, I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

[Chorus: All]
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still, I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, mmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

[Pre-Chorus: Wanyá Morris]
Will you love me again like you loved me before?
This time, I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me, don't let me down, oh

It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

[Interlude: Michael McCary, Shawn Stockman]
Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat all night (Baby, I'm here for you, baby)
Just like you did, baby, but that's alright
Heh, I love you anyway (Baby, you tried)
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day, baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby (We should be happy together forever)
'Cause you just won't come back to me (You and I)
Will you? Just come back to me (Yeah, yeah)

[Interlude: Michael McCary, All]
(Lonely) Yes, baby, my heart is lonely
(Lonely) My heart hurts, baby
(Lonely) Yes, I feel pain too
(Lonely) Baby, please

Baby Got Back Lyrics[Intro: Girls]
"Oh, my, god, Becky, look at her butt. It is so big. She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends. Who understands those rap guys? They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!"
[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (Me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She sweat, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!
[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back!
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh-ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sisters, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna—
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout

"Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha-ha, only if she's 5'3"."

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game, but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!
[Outro]
Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!37Embed

A young lovable, huggable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
'Cause inside out, it's wiggida wiggida wiggida wack

Save the Best for Last Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough
[Chorus]
And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

[Verse 2]
All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

[Chorus]
But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

[Bridge]

Just Another Day Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mornings alone
When you come home
I breathe a little faster
Every time we're together
It'd never be the same
(It’d never be the same)
If you're not here
How can you stay away, away so long?
Why can't we stay together?
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason
Give me a reason
[Chorus]    
'Cause I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
Make it through the day without you
I, I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
It's just another day

[Verse 2]
Making the time

And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder "Do you still love me?"
But after that, my whole world is beautiful

Black or White Lyrics[Intro: Michael Jackson]
Ow!
Ow!

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or White, ooh!
[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell 'em
I ain't second to none

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right, ooh!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or White, ooh!

Oh, when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Verse 3: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Achy Breaky Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]
You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh
[Verse 2]
You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

[Chorus]
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart

November Rain Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain
[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

[Refrain]
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

But if you could heal a broken heart

Life Is a Highway Lyrics[Verse 1]
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Verse 2]
Through all the cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hills
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, get back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

[Refrain]
There's no load I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way

This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

Don't look back, keep your head held high, don't ask them why
Because life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old

Sometime’s Love Just Ain’t Enough LyricsNow, I don't want to lose you, but I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you, but I don't want to be the one to cry
And that don't really matter to anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

(Chorus)
But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Now, I could never change you, I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you, but I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all
It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change
(Chorus)
And there's no way home, when it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say?
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you, where I used to lay?
And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes, love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes, love... it just ain't enough

Dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right?

You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am, still holding on
I can't accept my world is gone (No, no)

Even though I try, I can't let go
'Cause something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go

[Bridge]
Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside
Every day of my life?
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies?
I try and try to deny that I need you
But still, you remain on my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
Even though I try, I can't let go
(No, I just can't get you out of my mind)
Something in your eyes captured my soul
(I never can say goodbye)
'Cause every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let you go
Even though I try, I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
(Of something that I need so badly)
Every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go4Embed

Jump Around Lyrics[Produced by DJ Muggs]

[Verse 1: Everlast]
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk, ya better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up, (C'mon!) c'mon, throw your hands up
If ya got the feelin', jump up towards the ceilin'
Muggs let the funk flow, someone's talkin' junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk, and
I got more rhymes than there's cops at a Dunkin'
Donuts shop, sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
[Pre-Chorus: Everlast]
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around

[Chorus: Everlast]
Jump around (Jump around)
Jump around (Jump around)

Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)

[Verse 2: Everlast]
I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smackin' the ho *Smack*
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son, I've returned
Anyone steppin' to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If ya come to battle, bring a shotgun (Shotgun)
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skill, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't goin' out like no pro, bitch
Get used to one style and yo, and I might switch
It up, up and around, then buck, buck ya down
Put out ya head and then ya wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm comin' to get ya, I'm comin' to get ya

Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me Lyrics[Verse 1: George Michael]
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2: George Michael]
It's much too late to save myself from fallin'
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
[Chorus: George Michael]
Don't let the sun go down on me, yeah
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John

[Verse 3: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me (Baby, no)
Just because you think I mean you harm
(Just because you think I mean you harm, no)
But these cuts I have (Cuts I have)
They need love (They need love, they need love)
To help them heal, oh

[Chorus: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
'Cause losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me

Used to be that I believed in love

Can't go back to being on my own

I said I needed, needed to be free

Live and Learn Lyrics[Chorus]
You've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

[Verse 1: Kevin Scott]
Here's a little story about life
Everybody that lives surely dies
A lot of people ask the questions why
Some people have to go through so much more
Before they really learn about life's score
The subject is not to be ignored (Kick it to 'em, Joe)
[Pre-Chorus: Joe Sayles]
I don't wanna be the one
To tell you how it's gotta be
Livin' is the only way
You're ever really gonna see

You've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

Ah, yeah
Y'all, check it
Kick this one for the Public
Now break it down

[Verse 2: Kevin]
There's so much wrong and negativity
Enough for the whole world to see
I know there's still a possibility
You raise a little kid, he turns out bold
It may be from the way you treat him cold
I guess that's how the story's told (Tell 'em what it is)

[Rap: Kevin & (Joe Public)]
(Large) If large is how ya livin'
Why you're livin' large, are you takin' what is given
To you, in the form of true experience
'Cause if you're not your whole life could be spent
Doin' time for a crime you say you didn't even do
The only fool that you're foolin' is the fool that is you
Didn't even turn around to check and see if your bridge is burnin'
I guess it's true what they say that without livin' there's no learnin'
And this is from the J, the O, and the E

Mary, Mary, Mary, it's quite contrary
Yo', how did you earn your dough
You didn't finish school, you ain't got no job
But to the human eye it's pretty simple
You're always talkin' about what you want is respect
But never thinkin' about the little boy you neglect
Spendin' his formative years in a livin' hell
Not realizin' one day he'd end up in jail

Now on the other hand
There's Dan my man
Who planned a scam and I'll be damned
It was the ultimate flim flam
He was sayin' that it was easy as pie
But little did Dan know he was about to die

[Chorus Alt: (Joe)]
You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn

You've got to live and learn

Why are you calling all around
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl, you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game if you play that way

When I rub ya up and down
Yo Stylz, kick it

[Verse 5: Stylz]
Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in a style
So what I'm gonna do is kick in something fly and new
A change, this one from the typical
A bit more than regular, I'm not like the others, original
'Cause originality and creativity
Added up together equals the BBB Posse
Yeah, we in the house, yo, kick it

[Chorus: Background Singers & Bobby Brown]
Get up off my back (Come on)
Save your heart attack (Come on)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Throw your hands in the air, come on, come on)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
(I can make you bounce)
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Girl, you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why you think I'm foolin' around?
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody humpin' around, baby

Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover Lyrics[Verse 1]
That old dog has chained you up all right
Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero

[Chorus]
Damn I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Ohhhh
Ohhhh
[?]
[Verse 2]
This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
I give you something sweet each time you
Come inside my jungle book
What is it just too good
Don't say you'll stay
'Cause then you go away

[Chorus]
Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks
For me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn I wish I was your lover

[Bridge]
If I was your girl believe me
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
We could groove along and feel much better
Let me in
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in
Forever and ever and ever and ever

It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday Lyrics[Verse 1]
How do I say goodbye
To what we had?
The good times that made us laugh
Outweigh the bad

[Chorus]
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday
[Verse 2]
I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through, ooh

[Chorus]
If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye
To yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Tennessee Lyrics[Verse 1: Speech]
Lord, I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin' up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)
[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Verse 2: Speech]
Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree, my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me

But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth4Embed

Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed

He's gonna make it happen, make it happen

I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen, yeah
You can make it, make it happen
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it

If you believe in yourself enough (You're gonna make it)
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen

The One Lyrics[Verse 1]
I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one
[Verse 2]
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
Oh, you're all I ever needed

Set Adrift on Memory Bliss Lyrics[Hook]
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

[Verse 1]
The camera pans the cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing
I think it's one of those déjà vu things
Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me somethin'
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it
I don't know, I doubt it
Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone; solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend
She said, bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me
She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess
[Hook]
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

[Verse 2]
A careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring
An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
But guess whose piece of the cake was jacked on?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?
I feel for her, I really do
And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Stay LyricsIf this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go out alone
Don't think I'll understand

[Chorus]
(Stay) Stay with me
Stay with me
In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in-betweens
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more

[Chorus]
(Stay) Stay with me
Stay with me

You'd better hope and pray
That you make it safe back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray
That you wake one day in your own world
'Cuz when you sleep at night
They don't hear your cries in your own world
Only time will tell
If you can break the spell back in your own world

(Stay) Stay with me

So far away from me

Just think of all the moments

And I didn't mean to hurt you
But I know
That in the game of love
You reap what you sow

All I Want Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nothing so loud
As hearing when we lie
Truth is not kind
And you've said neither am I
And the air outside so soft is saying everything
Everything

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say

Nothing's so cold
As closing the heart when all we need
Is to free the soul
But we wouldn't be that brave I know
And the air outside so soft, confessing everything
Everything

All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say

And it won't matter now
Whatever happens will be
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be
It won't trouble me

When a Man Loves a Woman Lyrics
When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For the good thing he's found

If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on
To what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It oughtta be, hey

When a man loves a woman, hey
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him
Such misery

If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes
Can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause, baby, baby

Hazard Lyrics[Verse 1]
My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right
Three years ago when I came in on Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
Saw the man inside

[Chorus 1]
We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town
[Verse 2]
No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home
Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

[Chorus 2]
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

[Bridge]
I think about my life gone by
How it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone

I swear I left her safe and sound

Johnny, take a dive with your sister in the rain
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
To touch is to heal, to hurt is to steal
If you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
On your knees, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
She's the wave, she turns the tide
She sees the man inside the child

[Chorus]
It's alright, it's alright, alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
It's alright, it's alright, alright
She moves in mysterious ways, oh
It's alright, It's alright, alright
Lift my days, light up my nights, oh

One day you'll look back, and you'll see
Where you were held now by this love
While you could stand there
You could move on this moment
Follow this feeling

How Do You Talk to an Angel LyricsI hear her voice
In my mind
I know her face by heart
Heaven and earth are moving in my soul
And I dont know where to start
Tell me tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?
It's like tryin' to catch a falling star
At night I dream and she is there
And I can feel her in the air
Tell me tell me the words to define
The way I feel about someone so fine

How do you talk to an angel?
How do you hold her close to where you are?
How do you talk to an angel?

One Lyrics[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it
[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

[Chorus]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love a higher law

(Warm it up, Kris) I'm about to

[Verse 1: Mac Daddy]
So many times I heard you rhyme but you can't touch this
I'm kicking the type of flow that makes you say, "You're too much, Kris"
So feel the fire of the one they call the Mac Dad
The fire's what I pack and what I pack is real bad
I'd like to grab ahold of your soul and never let go
Do the jump, do the Hump, and say ("Ho!")
Now that's the state of mind I'm in, huh...
With rhyme after rhyme I win
The Mac (The Mac)
Known for breaking 'em off something
They laying in the back and front keeping your speakers pumping
The miggida-miggida-miggida Mac came to get 'em warm
And my pants to the back, that's my everyday uniform
You little cream puff Mac Daddy wannabe
Keep dreaming 'cause a Mac you will never be
So all y'all with the Dr. Seuss riddles
You can get the finger - the middle

[Hook 2X]

Ay, yo Kris, kick it

[Verse 2: Daddy Mac]
I caught you on the scope (the scope)
Peepin' out my rhymes that's this dope (it's dope)
And for you there's no hope
My name (is what?) Daddy Mac, baby
Totally Krossed Out catching all the ladies
At the age I be, I should be playing with toys
Instead I put my head into making you make noise
That's how I kick it, that's my everyday life and
I rehearse to keep it sharp as a knife, man
I'm the wrong brother for suckers to be messing with
'Cause when I put the mic in my hand I start wrecking it
They call me the D-A-double-D-Y-M-A-C
And there ain't another brother bad as me
When I (let go) something from the (ghetto), word

If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love

People Everyday Lyrics[Verse 1: Speech]
See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin'
Investigation maybe she was demonstratin'
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out
Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route
Disrespectin' my black queen
Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear (Boom!)
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearin' brothers dissin' it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me, see
[Chorus: Arrested Development]
I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

[Verse 2: Speech]
I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killin' Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Actin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see

[Chorus: Arrested Development]
I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

[Outro: Speech]
The moral of the story is
You better look very hard at who you're steppin' to
'Cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it

No Son of Mine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, the key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out
Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

[Verse 2]
I didn't think much about it
Till it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night
I couldn't stand to hear the crying of my mother
And I remember when I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me and I never went home again
[Pre-Chorus]
They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said:

[Chorus]
You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go and what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you

I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away
In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

[Pre-Chorus]
They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say
He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straight in the eyes
He said:

Wildside LyricsAh yeah huh American the beautiful
Huh yeah let me introduce y'all to the wildside
Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter
Come prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas singing nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it in all in stride
Cause deep inside annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside
(Chorus)

Ron had enough of being broke every day
Saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the wildside

(Chorus)

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job a good life. A good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside!

Little Tiffany. Only thirteen
Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch
But of the blue a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
Innocently on the wildside3Embed

Do I Have to Say the Words? LyricsRescue me from the mire
Whisper words of desire
Rescue me - darling, rescue me

With your arms open wide
Want you here by my side
Come to me - darling, rescue me

When this world's closing in
There's no need to pretend
Set me free - darling, rescue me
I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needing you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me please - darling, rescue me

Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can't you see - darling, rescue meSee Bryan Adams LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also likeEmbed

Friday I’m in Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday, you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate
[Verse 2]
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday, heart attack
Thursday, never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love

Monday, you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday, stay in bed
Or Thursday, watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

[Bridge]
Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throw out your frown and just smile at the sound
As sleek as a sheik, spinning round and round
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
It's Friday, I'm in love

Everything About You Lyrics[Intro]
Are you those guys on the beach that hate everything?
Eww! Is this some sort of hip music that I don't understand?

[Verse 1]
I hate the rain and sunny weather
And I, I hate the beach and mountains too, boo-hoo
And I don't like a thing about the city, no, no
And I, I, I, hate the countryside too!

[Chorus]
And I, hate everything about you
Everything about you
[Verse 2]
And I don't like a thing about your mother
And I, I hate your daddy's guts too, boo-hoo
And I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no
Cause I, I, I think sex is overrated too

[Chorus]
And I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you

[Bridge]
Some say I've got a bad attitude
But that don't change the way I feel about you
And if you think this might be bringing me down
Look again cause I ain't wearing no frown

Well, I don't really care about your sister
Forget the little bitch, cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
I put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe

I know you know everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it's gonna go
You think it's sad
Well that's too bad
Cause I'm havin'
A ball hatin'
Every little thing about you! ha-ha!

Missing You Now LyricsI talk to you but it's not the same as touchin' you
And every time you whisper my name ,I wanna run to you
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever and it's hard to be strong

Baby, 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you, baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait till I'm alone with you
To show you how I'm missing you now
Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do
Got my arms around my pillow at night
They should be holdin' you
Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know
I can't take this much longer, it's so hard on my soul

Baby, 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
I've gotta be with you, baby
I'm missing you now
Don't know what I'm gonna do
To show the way I'm missing you now

Baby, I just can't wait, till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside
When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms
Then and only then will I be satisfied
Missing you now

I know, we'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever and it's hard to be strong

Back to the Hotel Lyrics[Verse 1: TL]
V-Town, brother check it out, I'm bout to throw down
Dank in hand, the shit that has you toe down
A little city, chillin' in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boys don't play, fool
Yorker sidin', you know how the song goes
In the back, sippin' Purple Chongos
Don't look for trouble but it always seems to find us
Forty grippin', panty sippin', and it sneaks up right behind us
Quick left, one blow K.O
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh what the hell, I guess I better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kit on
A fifth of Heem, for me to get bent on
Hit the Country Club to pick up M-L
Eighty West, back to the hotel
[Verse 2: TL]
At the telly, Vogues is doing pipe work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The latte in the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me baby doll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, rolling striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 turnin' triple gold Zeens
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
'Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin' kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin' donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the telly, I gotta get some new cock
New cock (echoes)

[Verse 3: Jay Tee]
Aw naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad wanna do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her so I called TL

There goes the telly, so fella won't you slow down
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case, we gotta bust a quick one
Lock the load, let's go look for like 118
But lay low cause I really don't wanna be seen

Uh, ah
(Mike?) Yes?
[Verse 1: Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris]
The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see
Why can't we go all the way to the top?
The fullest extreme
The sounds I hear when you're with me
Express the way that you feel, girl (As you say)

[Chorus]
Uh, ah

[Verse 2: Nathan Morris, Wanya Morris]
In a passionate sense, we move in close
The love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name
Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide

The music is low, the lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows with every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust, and a lot of love
Sweet caresses, yes, it's good to be as you rub
And clench my back, ecstasy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck and stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight, I feel this is my duty
To grasp, to hold, to rock that booty

Real Love Lyrics[Produced by Mark Morales & Mark C. Rooney]

[Verse 1]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

[Bridge]
Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I'll find
A real love

[Verse 3]
So I've tried my best and prayed to God he'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

What About Your Friends Lyrics[Intro: All]
What, what about your friends?
What about
What about your friends?
What about your
What about your
What about your

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Every now and then, I get a little crazy
That's not the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah
People try to say I act a little funny
But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before, then you're still down with me, yeah
[Chorus: All]
What about your friends?
Will they stand their ground?
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends?
Are they gonna be low down?
Will they ever be around?
Or will they turn their backs on you?

[Refrain: Left Eye]
Well, is it me, or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically say?
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just 'cause I am what some choose to envy

[Verse 2: T-Boz, with Chilli]
Every now and then, I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see, I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true, they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

Thinkin’ Back LyricsHum...ohh baby..aww baby Yeah!
We goin' take you back a little further
Thinkin' back on you and me
Remembering how it use to be
Those times are precious, I cherish every moment we spent. Yeah!
Thinkin' back on all the arguments
Thinkin' back way back when
We kissed and made up and all was fair in love

So now we gotta go back baby (maybe we can turn the hands of time)
Going back to when (Going back to when you were mine)
When we were one (remembering the times when we were one, one in love)
When love was fun (ohh baby, baby)
Dig it...
Remembering the first time you showed me your love
The feeling was so strong heaven sent from above
But you had no right to play with my heart
You showed no shame
Time after time and place after place
Night after night and day after day
I'm still missing your love and the feelings we share
Sometimes I cry at night coz' I feel so all alone
I need your love right here with me to keep me safe and warm

(maybe we can turn the hands of time)
I'm going back to when (going back to when, when you were mine)
When we were one...we were one girl

That’s What Love Is For Lyrics[Verse 1]
Sometimes we make it harder than it is
We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far
[Chorus]
That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I see you
And you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away
By emotions I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire
And holding on we find

Keep Coming Back LyricsYou know just how to hurt me
And how to take all the pain away
Girl, you must be the devil in disguise

When I was so afraid of you
There's some kind of madness in your eyes

You know a place buried deep in my heart
Nobody else can see
Something in you has taken some kind of hold on me

I don't know why I keep coming back to you

That nobody else could do
Why should I try, I don't want to get over you

I'm so in love, so in love with the games that you play
So in love, and nothing can keep me away

Just Take My Heart LyricsIt's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping
I can't imagine living my life after you're gone
Wondering why so many questions have no answers
I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong

Where is our yesterday
You and I could use it right now
But if this is goodbye...

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go
Here we are about to take the final step now
I just can't fool myself, I know there's no turning back
Face to face it's been an endless conversation
But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk

I'd give my everything
If only I could turn you around
But if this is goodbye...

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold

We got a— we got a love, we got a— we got a love
We got a— just how a love should be

[Verse 2]
I used to be lonely, yeah
'Cause I couldn't find someone that I could call my own
No, no
Suddenly you stepped in my life
Now you're here with me and all my lonely days are gone
They are gone, oh, no
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But it's better than the lonely nights
I know that I won't find a better love
I've got a love that other girls dream of, hey, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy

[Chorus]
We got a love thang (Love thang)
Feels so good to me (Feels so good to me)
This is our thang (Our thang)
Just how a love should be (Don't you know that's just how a love should be?)

Let’s Get Rocked Lyrics[Intro]
Do you wanna get rocked?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

[Verse 1]
I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothing, in fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day but daddy don't agree
Because when I try to get away, he says, he got plans for me
"Get your butt right out of bed"
Stop bugging me
"Get up and move your sleepy head"
Don't shake my tree
He said, "Mow the lawn", who me?
"Walk the dog", not my style, man
"Take out the trash", no way
"Tidy your room", come on, get real
Sorry Dad, got to disappear
Let's get the rock out of here
[Chorus 1]
Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

[Chorus 2]
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

[Verse 2]
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Driving with my baby to get her in the mood
She's dialing through my radio and I'm ready to make my move
What she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well, I'm sorry, girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question

[Chorus 1]
Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

[Verse 3]
Hey, all I want to do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you, I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancing with this broom
I feel lucky today
Hey, look at that, man
Do you want to get rocked?
Do you want to get rocked?
Ho, it won't take you a minute
It won't take that long
So get on, get with it
Oh, come on everybody

[Chorus 2]
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Do you wanna, do you wanna?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top of it
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Love to rock your body baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Let's get out and play, rock the night away
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
[Outro]

They Want EFX Lyrics[Verse 1]
Bum stiggedy bum stiggedy bum, hon, I got the old pa-rum-pum-pum-pum
But I can fe-fi or fo, diddly-bum, here I come
So Peter Piper, I'm hyper than Pinocchio's nose
'Cause I'm the supercalafragilistic tic-tac pro
I gave my oopsy, daisy, now you've got the Crazy
Drazy with the books, Googley-goo where's the gravy
So one two, um, buckle my, um shoe
Yabba Doo, hippity-hoo, crack a brew
So trick or treat, smell my feet, yup I drippedy-dropped a hit
So books get on your mark and spark that old censorship
Drats and double drats, I smiggedy-smacked some whiz kids
The boogedy-woogedly Brooklyn boy's about to get his, dig
My waist bone's connected to my hip bone
My hip bone's connected to my thigh bone
My thigh bone's connected to my knee bone
My knee bone's connected to my hardy-har-har-har
The jibbedy-jabber jaw ja-jabbing at your funny bone, um
Skip the Ovaltine, I'd rather have my honeycomb
Or preferably the sinsemilla, Let's spiggedy-spark the blunts, um
Dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Well I'll be darned, shiver me timbers yo, head for the hills!
I picked a weeping willow, and a daffodil
So back up bucko or I'll pulverize McGruff
'Cause, this little piggy gets, busy and stuff
Arrivederci, heavens to mercy, honky tonk I get swift
I caught a Snuffleupagus and smoked a boogaloo spliff
I got the nooks, the crannies, the nitty gritty 40 doe
So all aboard, castaway, hey where's my boogaloo?
Oh-h-h-h-h-h-hhh I'm steamin, a-go-ny!
Why's everybody always pickin on me?
They call me Puddin' Tane, and rap's my game
You ask me again and I'll t-tell you the same
Since I'm the vocal vegemintarian, stick 'em up freeze
So no Parks sausages, mom, please
A-Blitz shoots the breeze, twiddly-dee shoots his lip
Crazy Drayzie shot the sheriff yup, and I shot the gift
And that's PRET-TY SNEA-KY SIS, oh yo
I got my socks off, my rocks off, my Nestle's cup of cocoa
Holly Hobbie tried to slob me, tried to rob me silly stunt
Diggedy-dun dun dun dun dun, DUN DUN!

I Can’t Make You Love Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
[Verse 2]
I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don'tSee Bonnie Raitt LiveGet tickets as low as $25You might also like6Embed
