And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
But in another life, I would be your girl

And I wonder if you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong, and I don't belong
Livin' in your precious memory

'Cause I'll need you
And I'll miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Oh, 'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight
I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't
Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast, faces pass
And I'm homebound
Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way
Makin' a way through the crowd
And I still need you
I still miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, oh-oh
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?

(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try

To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

And how I had a triflin' mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard, cry with me, die with me

But I, learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'

Yes, I need affection, let's go Mario

But as long as were here, then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mami, I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma, I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?

No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you I believe in

Maybe transfers

Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

I never meant to hurt you

But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry

He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

Uh-huh, come on
You can say I'm plain Jane but it's not the same
I ain't into big names but I like nice things
I watch boxin' matches and the football games
I wouldn't mind being an actress but I love to sing
I like goin' out, takin' walks and stuff
I don't run with many girls 'cause they talk too much
I enjoy quiet nights at home and curl up next to ya
Though I'm ain't a virgin that don't mean I'm havin' sex with ya
Anywhere I go I'm spotted
(Fo' real and that's no question)
And anything I want I got it

Baby, look me in the eyes and tell me yeah
I'm the kind of girl you like, I'm feelin' you
'Cause sweetie you're my kind of guy, that's what it is
Think about it you just might wanna run with this
All night long and if you want me, we can keep this going
But let me tell you I'm the type that's strong
And I don't trust a lot of men, I'm independent
I ain't like some other women

Baby girl don't you know you're a star
We could take a little trip to mi casa
Spend the night popping cris in the hot tub
See I ain't never seen no girl like you
Every sexy little thing you do
5'5' brown eyes with your thick thighs
Every time I see your smile its got me hypnotized
I keep 'em mesmerized, listen to me closely
E-V-E is how a thorough bred supposed to be
Hate the thirsty type, can't even get close to me
That's why I got my own stack, Daddy, how it's supposed to be
I ain't about the game, playin' and gift chasin'
All in frontin' Daddy please, we both big facin'
All the things I want, I got, forget me not
Just from my stance, why you starin' at me? Got you hot
Not too many bitches like her, one of a kind
I mean even the bitches like her, she just a dime
Not impressed by your Cris' poppin' 'cause if you would
I might end, of the night we gone be lip locking
But only if I choose to, I don't fall in love easily
Give you the blues Boo, I have you sittin'
'Round misty-eyed Caramel, get 'em all the time

I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself

And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing

Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
Of a corner bar, and it just seemed right so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
But he walked up, and said, ""What'll it be?""
I said, ""The good stuff""
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said ""You can't find that here""
'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said, ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed, like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""
He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new T-shirt saying, ""I'm a Grandpa""
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up

Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke

I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine

Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door

I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right

Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti

Across the pasture at our home

A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew
There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God

Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna—
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)

Well I ain't down with that!

Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game, but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown

Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me somethin'
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it

I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone; solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend
She said, bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me
She was right, though, I can't lie

Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
But guess whose piece of the cake was jacked on?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?

And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest

Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin'
Investigation maybe she was demonstratin'
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out
Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route
Disrespectin' my black queen
Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood

Somewhere I could call mine

Till it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night

Huh yeah let me introduce y'all to the wildside
Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter
Come prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas singing nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it in all in stride
Cause deep inside annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside
(Chorus)

Ron had enough of being broke every day
Saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the wildside

(Chorus)

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job a good life. A good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside!

Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch
But of the blue a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
Innocently on the wildside3

An only child, alone and wild; a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work and his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay
A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline - a thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand
The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
My brothers' lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well
I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And, Papa, I don't think I said 'I love you' near enough

A place I didn't want to be

To gamble on love just one time

It seemed like a perfect crime
Baby, you left me defenseless
But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key

Like a thousand times before
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door

I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
""My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home""
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, well who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally
It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally23

I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock 'n' roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark

Eight miles high and fallin' fast

While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance

'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

And talk about their homes

And she works layin' whiskey down

There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

A clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine
Jumpin' slick was my ruin
'Cause, I found out all I was doin'
Was making it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, oh yeah
Just making it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, uh-huh, mhm
I took this man's love and put it on a shelf
And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself

But I found out that all I had done
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, uh-huh
Yeah, that's what I did, I made it easy for the clean up woman
To steal my baby's love, oh yeah
The clean up woman will wipe his blues away
She'll give him plenty lovin' 24 hours a day
The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet

564,65,"""Hurting Each Other""",The Carpenters,Pop,Group,"O black boy of Atlanta!
But half was spoken;
The slave’s chains and the master’s
Alike are broken;
The one curse of the races
Held both in tether;
They are rising—all are rising—
The black and white together.
WHITTIER.

SOUTH of the North, yet north of the South, lies the City of a Hundred Hills, peering out from the shadows of the past into the promise of the future. I have seen her in the morning, when the first flush of day had half-roused her; she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of Georgia; then the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys, the tinkle of bell and scream of whistle broke the silence, the rattle and roar of busy life slowly gathered and swelled, until the seething whirl of the city seemed a strange thing in a sleepy land.
Once, they say, even Atlanta slept dull and drowsy at the foot-hills of the Alleghanies, until the iron baptism of war awakened her with its sullen waters, aroused and maddened her, and left her listening to the sea. And the sea cried to the hills and the hills answered the sea, till the city rose like a widow and cast away her weeds, and toiled for her daily bread; toiled steadily, toiled cunningly,—perhaps with some bitterness, with a touch of réclame,—and yet with real earnestness, and real sweat.
It is a hard thing to live haunted by the ghost of an untrue dream; to see the wide vision of empire fade into real ashes and dirt; to feel the pang of the conquered, and yet know that with all the Bad that fell on one black day, something was vanquished that deserved to live, something killed that in justice had not dared to die; to know that with the Right that triumphed, triumphed something of Wrong, something sordid and mean, something less than the broadest and best. All this is bitter hard; and many a man and city and people have found in it excuse for sulking, and brooding, and listless waiting.
Such are not men of the sturdier make; they of Atlanta turned resolutely toward the future; and that future held aloft vistas of purple and gold:—Atlanta, Queen of the cotton kingdom; Atlanta, Gateway to the Land of the Sun; Atlanta, the new Lachesis, spinner of web and woof for the world. So the city crowned her hundred hills with factories, and stored her shops with cunning handiwork, and stretched long iron ways to greet the busy Mercury in his coming. And the Nation talked of her striving.
Perhaps Atlanta was not christened for the winged maiden of dull Boeotia; you know the tale,—how swarthy Atalanta, tall and wild, would marry only him who out-raced her; and how the wily Hippomenes laid three apples of gold in the way. She fled like a shadow, paused, startled over the first apple, but even as he stretched his hand, fled again; hovered over the second, then, slipping from his hot grasp, flew over river, vale, and hill; but as she lingered over the third, his arms fell round her, and looking on each other, the blazing passion of their love profaned the sanctuary of Love, and they were cursed. If Atlanta be not named for Atalanta, she ought to have been.
Atalanta is not the first or the last maiden whom greed of gold has led to defile the temple of Love; and not maids alone, but men in the race of life, sink from the high and generous ideals of youth to the gambler’s code of the Bourse; and in all our Nation’s striving is not the Gospel of Work befouled by the Gospel of Pay? So common is this that one-half think it normal; so unquestioned, that we almost fear to question if the end of racing is not gold, if the aim of man is not rightly to be rich. And if this is the fault of America, how dire a danger lies before a new land and a new city, lest Atlanta, stooping for mere gold, shall find that gold accursed!
It was no maiden’s idle whim that started this hard racing; a fearful wilderness lay about the feet of that city after the War,—feudalism, poverty, the rise of the Third Estate, serfdom, the re-birth of Law and Order, and above and between all, the Veil of Race. How heavy a journey for weary feet! what wings must Atalanta have to flit over all this hollow and hill, through sour wood and sullen water, and by the red waste of sun-baked clay! How fleet must Atalanta be if she will not be tempted by gold to profane the Sanctuary!
The Sanctuary of our fathers has, to be sure, few Gods,—some sneer, “all too few.” There is the thrifty Mercury of New England, Pluto of the North, and Ceres of the West; and there, too, is the half-forgotten Apollo of the South, under whose ægis the maiden ran,—and as she ran she forgot him, even as there in Boeotia Venus was forgot. She forgot the old ideal of the Southern gentleman,—that new-world heir of the grace and courtliness of patrician, knight, and noble; forgot his honor with his foibles, his kindliness with his carelessness, and stooped to apples of gold,—to men busier and sharper, thriftier and more unscrupulous. Golden apples are beautiful—I remember the lawless days of boyhood, when orchards in crimson and gold tempted me over fence and field—and, too, the merchant who has dethroned the planter is no despicable parvenu. Work and wealth are the mighty levers to lift this old new land; thrift and toil and saving are the highways to new hopes and new possibilities; and yet the warning is needed lest the wily Hippomenes tempt Atalanta to thinking that golden apples are the goal of racing, and not mere incidents by the way.
Atlanta must not lead the South to dream of material prosperity as the touchstone of all success; already the fatal might of this idea is beginning to spread; it is replacing the finer type of Southerner with vulgar money-getters; it is burying the sweeter beauties of Southern life beneath pretence and ostentation. For every social ill the panacea of Wealth has been urged,—wealth to overthrow the remains of the slave feudalism; wealth to raise the “cracker” Third Estate; wealth to employ the black serfs, and the prospect of wealth to keep them working; wealth as the end and aim of politics, and as the legal tender for law and order; and, finally, instead of Truth, Beauty, and Goodness, wealth as the ideal of the Public School.
Not only is this true in the world which Atlanta typifies, but it is threatening to be true of a world beneath and beyond that world,—the Black World beyond the Veil. To-day it makes little difference to Atlanta, to the South, what the Negro thinks or dreams or wills. In the soul-life of the land he is to-day, and naturally will long remain, unthought of, half forgotten; and yet when he does come to think and will and do for himself,—and let no man dream that day will never come,—then the part he plays will not be one of sudden learning, but words and thoughts he has been taught to lisp in his race-childhood. To-day the ferment of his striving toward self-realization is to the strife of the white world like a wheel within a wheel: beyond the Veil are smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and the led, of serfdom, of poverty, of order and subordination, and, through all, the Veil of Race. Few know of these problems, few who know notice them; and yet there they are, awaiting student, artist, and seer,—a field for somebody sometime to discover. Hither has the temptation of Hippomenes penetrated; already in this smaller world, which now indirectly and anon directly must influence the larger for good or ill, the habit is forming of interpreting the world in dollars. The old leaders of Negro opinion, in the little groups where there is a Negro social consciousness, are being replaced by new; neither the black preacher nor the black teacher leads as he did two decades ago. Into their places are pushing the farmers and gardeners, the well-paid porters and artisans, the businessmen,—all those with property and money. And with all this change, so curiously parallel to that of the Other-world, goes too the same inevitable change in ideals. The South laments to-day the slow, steady disappearance of a certain type of Negro,—the faithful, courteous slave of other days, with his incorruptible honesty and dignified humility. He is passing away just as surely as the old type of Southern gentleman is passing, and from not dissimilar causes,—the sudden transformation of a fair far-off ideal of Freedom into the hard reality of bread-winning and the consequent deification of Bread.
In the Black World, the Preacher and Teacher embodied once the ideals of this people,—the strife for another and a juster world, the vague dream of righteousness, the mystery of knowing; but to-day the danger is that these ideals, with their simple beauty and weird inspiration, will suddenly sink to a question of cash and a lust for gold. Here stands this black young Atalanta, girding herself for the race that must be run; and if her eyes be still toward the hills and sky as in the days of old, then we may look for noble running; but what if some ruthless or wily or even thoughless Hippomenes lay golden apples before her? What if the Negro people be wooed from a strife for righteousness, from a love of knowing, to regard dollars as the be-all and end-all of life? What if to the Mammonism of America be added the rising Mammonism of the re-born South, and the Mammonism of this South be reinforced by the budding Mammonism of its half-awakened black millions? Whither, then, is the new-world quest of Goodness and Beauty and Truth gone glimmering? Must this, and that fair flower of Freedom which, despite the jeers of latter-day striplings, sprung from our fathers’ blood, must that too degenerate into a dusty quest of gold,—into lawless lust with Hippomenes?

The hundred hills of Atlanta are now all crowned with factories. On one, toward the west, the setting sun throws three buildings in bold relief against the sky. The beauty of the group lies in its simple unity:—a broad lawn of green rising from the red street with mingled roses and peaches; north and south, two plain and stately halls; and in the midst, half hidden in ivy, a larger building, boldly graceful, sparingly decorated, and with one low spire. It is a restful group,—one never looks for more; it is all here, all intelligible. There I live, and there I hear from day to day the low hum of restful life. In winter’s twilight, when the red sun glows, I can see the dark figures pass between the halls to the music of the night-bell. In the morning, when the sun is golden, the clang of the day-bell brings the hurry and laughter of three hundred young hearts from hall and street, and from the busy city below,—children all dark and heavy-haired,—to join their clear young voices in the music of the morning sacrifice. In a half-dozen class-rooms they gather then,—here to follow the love-song of Dido, here to listen to the tale of Troy divine; there to wander among the stars, there to wander among men and nations,—and elsewhere other well-worn ways of knowing this queer world. Nothing new, no time-saving devices,—simply old time-glorified methods of delving for Truth, and searching out the hidden beauties of life, and learning the good of living. The riddle of existence is the college curriculum that was laid before the Pharaohs, that was taught in the groves by Plato, that formed the trivium and quadrivium, and is to-day laid before the freedmen’s sons by Atlanta University. And this course of study will not change; its methods will grow more deft and effectual, its content richer by toil of scholar and sight of seer; but the true college will ever have one goal,—not to earn meat, but to know the end and aim of that life which meat nourishes.
The vision of life that rises before these dark eyes has in it nothing mean or selfish. Not at Oxford or at Leipsic, not at Yale or Columbia, is there an air of higher resolve or more unfettered striving; the determination to realize for men, both black and white, the broadest possibilities of life, to seek the better and the best, to spread with their own hands the Gospel of Sacrifice,—all this is the burden of their talk and dream. Here, amid a wide desert of caste and proscription, amid the heart-hurting slights and jars and vagaries of a deep race-dislike, lies this green oasis, where hot anger cools, and the bitterness of disappointment is sweetened by the springs and breezes of Parnassus; and here men may lie and listen, and learn of a future fuller than the past, and hear the voice of Time:
“Entbehren sollst du, sollst entbehren.”

They made their mistakes, those who planted Fisk and Howard and Atlanta before the smoke of battle had lifted; they made their mistakes, but those mistakes were not the things at which we lately laughed somewhat uproariously. They were right when they sought to found a new educational system upon the University: where, forsooth, shall we ground knowledge save on the broadest and deepest knowledge? The roots of the tree, rather than the leaves, are the sources of its life; and from the dawn of history, from Academus to Cambridge, the culture of the University has been the broad foundation-stone on which is built the kindergarten’s A B C.
But these builders did make a mistake in minimizing the gravity of the problem before them; in thinking it a matter of years and decades; in therefore building quickly and laying their foundation carelessly, and lowering the standard of knowing, until they had scattered haphazard through the South some dozen poorly equipped high schools and miscalled them universities. They forgot, too, just as their successors are forgetting, the rule of inequality:—that of the million black youth, some were fitted to know and some to dig; that some had the talent and capacity of university men, and some the talent and capacity of blacksmiths; and that true training meant neither that all should be college men nor all artisans, but that the one should be made a missionary of culture to an untaught people, and the other a free workman among serfs. And to seek to make the blacksmith a scholar is almost as silly as the more modern scheme of making the scholar a blacksmith; almost, but not quite.

The function of the university is not simply to teach bread-winning, or to furnish teachers for the public schools, or to be a centre of polite society; it is, above all, to be the organ of that fine adjustment between real life and the growing knowledge of life, an adjustment which forms the secret of civilization. Such an institution the South of to-day sorely needs. She has religion, earnest, bigoted:—religion that on both sides the Veil often omits the sixth, seventh, and eighth commandments, but substitutes a dozen supplementary ones. She has, as Atlanta shows, growing thrift and love of toil; but she lacks that broad knowledge of what the world knows and knew of human living and doing, which she may apply to the thousand problems of real life to-day confronting her. The need of the South is knowledge and culture,—not in dainty limited quantity, as before the war, but in broad busy abundance in the world of work; and until she has this, not all the Apples of Hesperides, be they golden and bejewelled, can save her from the curse of the Boeotian lovers.
The Wings of Atalanta are the coming universities of the South. They alone can bear the maiden past the temptation of golden fruit. They will not guide her flying feet away from the cotton and gold; for—ah, thoughtful Hippomenes!—do not the apples lie in the very Way of Life? But they will guide her over and beyond them, and leave her kneeling in the Sanctuary of Truth and Freedom and broad Humanity, virgin and undefiled. Sadly did the Old South err in human education, despising the education of the masses, and niggardly in the support of colleges. Her ancient university foundations dwindled and withered under the foul breath of slavery; and even since the war they have fought a failing fight for life in the tainted air of social unrest and commercial selfishness, stunted by the death of criticism, and starving for lack of broadly cultured men. And if this is the white South’s need and danger, how much heavier the danger and need of the freedmen’s sons! how pressing here the need of broad ideals and true culture, the conservation of soul from sordid aims and petty passions! Let us build the Southern university—William and Mary, Trinity, Georgia, Texas, Tulane, Vanderbilt, and the others—fit to live; let us build, too, the Negro universities:—Fisk, whose foundation was ever broad; Howard, at the heart of the Nation; Atlanta at Atlanta, whose ideal of scholarship has been held above the temptation of numbers. Why not here, and perhaps elsewhere, plant deeply and for all time centres of learning and living, colleges that yearly would send into the life of the South a few white men and a few black men of broad culture, catholic tolerance, and trained ability, joining their hands to other hands, and giving to this squabble of the Races a decent and dignified peace?
Patience, Humility, Manners, and Taste, common schools and kindergartens, industrial and technical schools, literature and tolerance,—all these spring from knowledge and culture, the children of the university. So must men and nations build, not otherwise, not upside down.

Teach workers to work,—a wise saying; wise when applied to German boys and American girls; wiser when said of Negro boys, for they have less knowledge of working and none to teach them. Teach thinkers to think,—a needed knowledge in a day of loose and careless logic; and they whose lot is gravest must have the carefulest training to think aright. If these things are so, how foolish to ask what is the best education for one or seven or sixty million souls! shall we teach them trades, or train them in liberal arts? Neither and both: teach the workers to work and the thinkers to think; make carpenters of carpenters, and philosophers of philosophers, and fops of fools. Nor can we pause here. We are training not isolated men but a living group of men,—nay, a group within a group. And the final product of our training must be neither a psychologist nor a brickmason, but a man. And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living,—not sordid money-getting, not apples of gold. The worker must work for the glory of his handiwork, not simply for pay; the thinker must think for truth, not for fame. And all this is gained only by human strife and longing; by ceaseless training and education; by founding Right on righteousness and Truth on the unhampered search for Truth; by founding the common school on the university, and the industrial school on the common school; and weaving thus a system, not a distortion, and bringing a birth, not an abortion. 19

When night falls on the City of a Hundred Hills, a wind gathers itself from the seas and comes murmuring westward. And at its bidding, the smoke of the drowsy factories sweeps down upon the mighty city and covers it like a pall, while yonder at the University the stars twinkle above Stone Hall. And they say that yon gray mist is the tunic of Atalanta pausing over her golden apples. Fly, my maiden, fly, for yonder comes Hippomenes!

If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all
It's got overdrive, just won't stall
With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
The brakes are good, tires fair

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin'
And down in the dips she started to rockin'
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail
And called my pappy to throw my bail

Yeah, I know what you're talkin' about
Uhh
There was a time when man did live in caves as we all know
These people were known as cave men, neanderthal men or troglodytes

What we're gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time
When the only people that existed were troglodytes... cave men...
Cave women... Neanderthal... troglodytes. Let's take the average
Cave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up
Try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this:
""Dance... dance"". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look
In the mirror: ""Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a
Woman gotta find a woman"". He'd go down to the lake where all the
Woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look
Around and just reach in and grab one. ""Come here... come here""
He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause
It might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd
Be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there
Wet and frightened. He said: ""Move... move"". She got up. She was a
Big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one
Of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said:
""Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me
Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!"". She looked down on him
She was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said
(Falsetto):
""I'll sock it to ya, Daddy"". He said: ""Wha?"". She said (falsetto):
""I'll sock it to ya, Daddy"". You know what he said? He started it way
Back then. I wouldn't lie to you. When she said (falsetto)
""I'll sock it to ya, Daddy"" he said ""Right on! Right on! Hotpants!
Hotpants! Ugh... ugh... ugh""You might also like

I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light
Oh, where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain
She just looked out the window
She said, ""Sixteen Parkside Lane""
Something about her was familiar
I could swear I seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more
It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
Then she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile just the same
And she said, ""How are you, Harry?""
I said, ""How are you, Sue?
Through the too many miles and the too little smiles
I still remember you""
It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of a Dodge

Past the gate and the fine-trimmed lawns
And she said, ""We must get together""
But I knew it'd never be arranged
Then she hand me twenty dollars for a two-fifty fare
She said, ""Harry, keep the change""
Well, another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go
I stashed the bill in my shirt
And she walked away in silence
It's strange how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago
You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights

And here she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home

Spent his whole life walking plowed ground

He had a one-room shack not far from us
And well, we was about as poor as him
He had one old mule he called Midnight
And I'd trailed along after them
He used to plow them rows straight and deep
And I'd come along near behind
A-bustin' up clods with my own bare feet
Old Rivers was a friend of mine

That sun'd get high and that mule would work
Till old Rivers'd say, Whoa!
He'd wipe his brow, lean back on the reins
And talk about a place he was gonna go

I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there amoung the clouds

He led his men through waters dark rocky reefs and hungry sharks
He braved the enemy's bayonets a thirty eight hung round his neck
Four more days and four more nights a rescue boat pulled into sight

Would be the leader of the nation be the one to take command

Look at that big hand move along
Nearing high noon
He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life for his an'
I'm not afraid of death but, oh, what shall I do
If you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
Although you're grievin', don't think of leavin'
Now that I need you by my side

Wait along (wait along)
Wait along
Wait along (wait along, wait along, wait along, wait along)You might also like

721,22,"""It's in the Book""",Johnny Standley,Pop,Male,"I have a message for you, a very sad message
My subject for this evening will be
Little Bo Peep
It says here, Little Bo Peep
Who was a little girl
Has lost her sheep
And doesn't know where to find them
Now that's reasonable, isn't it

It's, it's reasonable to assume
If Little Bo Peep had lost her sheep
It's only natural
That she wouldn't know where to find them
That, that basically is reasonable
But, uh, ""leave them alone
Now that overwhelms me
Completely overwhelms me
The man said she lost her sheep
Turns right around and boldly states
""She doesn't know where to find them""
And then has the stupid audacity to say
""Leave them alone""
Now, now, now think for a moment, think
If the sheep were lost
And you couldn't find them
You'd have to leave them alone, wouldn't you
So, leave them alone
Leave them alone
It's in the book
Leave them alone and they
They being the sheep, ""they will come home""
Ah yes, they'll come home
Oh, there'll be a brighter day tomorrow
They will come home
It's in the book

They will come home a-waggin' their tails
Pray tell me what else could they wag
They will come home a-waggin' their tales
Behind them, behind them
Did we think they'd wag them in front
Of course, they might have come home in reverse
They could have done that, I really don't know
But, none the less
It's in the book

So now if you will, kindly pick up your books
And turn to page 222
We'll ask you all to sing
You'll find your books on the backs of your seats
Are we ready

Everyone, 222
Let's really enjoy ourselves
Let's live it up
All together

Good for everything in the home
And the secret was in the scrubbing
It wouldn't suds and couldn't foam

Then let us all sing right out of grandma's
Of grandma's lye soap
Used for, for everything
Everything on the place
For pots and kettles
The dirty dishes
And for your hands and for your face

Shall we now sing the second verse
Let's get it with great exuberance, let's live it up
It's not raining inside tonight
Everyone, let's have a happy time
Are we ready
All together, the second verse

Little Herman and brother Thurman
Had an aversion to washing their ears
Grandma scrubbed them with the lye soap
And they haven't heard a word in years

Then let us all sing right out of grandma's
Of grandma's lye soap
Sing all out, all over the place
The pots and kettles, the dirty dishes
And also hands and also f.....
(clapping fades)
Well, let's sing what's left of the last verse
Let's have a happy time, everyone
The last verse, al-l-l-l together
Ev-v-v-very one

Mm-m-m-m, thank you kindly, kindly
M-m-mrs, O'Malley, out in the valley
Suffered from ulcers, I understand
She swallowed a cake of grandma's lye soap
Has the cleanest ulcers in the land

Then let us all sing right out of grandma's
Of grandma's lye soap
Sing right out, all over the place
The pots and, the pots and pans, oh dirty dishes
And the hands..
