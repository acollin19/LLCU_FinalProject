Wheel of Fortune LyricsThe wheel of fortune
Goes spinning around
Will the arrow point my way?
Will this be my day?

Oh, wheel of fortune
Please don't pass me by
Let me know the magic of
A kiss and a sigh

While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning
I'll not dream of winning
Fortune or fame
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning
I'll be yearning, yearning
For love's precious flame
Oh, wheel of fortune
I'm hoping somehow
If you'll ever smile on me
Please let it be now

While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning
I'll not dream of winning
Fortune or even fame
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning
I'll be yearning, yearning
For love's precious flame

Oh, wheel of fortune
I'm hoping somehow
If you ever smile on me
Please let it be nowYou might also likeEmbed

Smoking on pack, you can smell the aroma
Young ass nigga but they think that I'm older

World on my shoulders, feel like a boulder
Run up on me, I told you that it's over
Chopper get to doin' motherfuckers like it's homework

Now a nigga wildin', feeling like a rasta
Choppa like guitar, get to strummin' like a rockstar

I put this .40 to your head and then I pop it

Optimus Primin'
Transform on your ho to fuck her for perfect timing
Rollie change colors like the climate
Diamonds on my neck, best believe them bitches shining
I left my chains at the hotel, I hate jewelry
I wear it just so I can participate in the foolery
You got a problem with me? I'ma pull up with this chopper
I'll shoot you and your father, put an end to your eulogy, uh
Clip hold a hundred, kinda like a centipede

Run up on me, you get popped like I'm popping all the pills
Spazzin' on every track, I battlerap
Anyone that's gon' battlerap, come battle that

Spazzin' on they ass like every track that Westwood put on

Tatted on my face? Nah
Tatted on my neck? Yeah
Tatted on my chest? Nah

I feel like a rich bitch, probably 'cause I'm rich, bitch
I feel like I'm Rick James
Run up on me, chopper hit your ass like, "Okay"
Black bullets hit your fuckin' body like Luke Cage, huh
It's a motherfuckin' outrage, nigga
These niggas make me mad thinking they can compete
I swear to God, they flow ain't nothin' to me
But Juice WRLD 999, he's something to see
It's so hard when he rap that it's make-believe
"He can't be freestylin' that shit for real, he be writing it"
Nah, this off the dome, I do it to be excitin'
I feel like a Buddha or somethin', my flow is enlightening
But I'm not with that folly shit
Pop it like an ollie, bitch
I was off the molly in a party with a bitch that's acting faker than a Barbie, kid
Run up, you get grilled just like a Que, ain't talking barbe', kid
I'm the type to top-, oof, hold on watch this
Chopper on my side, it's 'bout the size of a hockey
Shit, I shoot it in your brain and see your thoughts, psychologist

Put my arm up in the rim, I feel like Vince, I feel like Carter
I been ballin' like a starter
Put my dick inside your daughter
Matter of fact, bitch, I'm your father
Niggas thinkin' that they gettin' it, but I'm tellin' 'em, "Why bother?"
Make him disappear like Potter
I swear to God I was whippin' all this crack up in this pot
I'm making music for the problems
Yeah, I'm making music for the problems, yeah
I'm known to make hits, take bitches and take pills
I make thrills, chase thrills and make mills
I eat meals and chill out with my bro
Chris Mills, we pop willy like Meek Mills
I'm in the cut gettin' head from a bitch
After that she could be dead, I wouldn't give a fuck
She get on her knees and it's ironic that she get on her knees so Juice WRLD could live it up
That bitch said that she ready to give it up
I said, "Pull your panties down, baby, the jig is up"
I seen a bunch of crack pipes and cigarettes
I ain't wanna fuck her, no way, serve to her mother, bruh
Huh, that's word to your mom
If you looking for me I'm probably puttin' dick in your mom
If you looking for me I'm probably putting shit in your mom
If you looking for me I'm probably tryna sniff with your mom, huh
I feel like the bomb, Osam'
You ain't on shit, nigga, really, dot com
You don't really know the shit that I'm on
You don't really know this spliff, my mind gone

Look, mhm
Hi kids, do you like Oxy?
Do you wanna get it poppin' like a molly? Prolly

Bombing like a motherfucking kamikaze
Hit him in his face with the chopper, sorry
That bitch finna sing like an opera, Harley
I'ma box him out, left, right, I feel like Ali
I'ma play your bitch like her first name Atari
I'ma grill the pussy like it's fresh calamari
Try me if you want, that chopper on me get to killin'
Blood all on the floor, you know that shit just got to spillin'
I don't give a fuck, nigga, I'm such an evil villain
Louis V 'Preme on my shirt cost ten bands
Pull up on the scene, chopper hit you and your best friend
Married to the money even though I am the best man
She hold my dick like a mic she was testin'
It's time to spazz on a track, that's what I do, uh-uh
Gun sing like Erykah Badu, uh-huh
Throw your body in the bottom of the bayou
So rich, motherfucker, I could buy you
Don't try me, but nigga, I will try you
I hope your ass ready to die, dude
Choppa on me, leave your mama traumatized, dude
Like a bunch of chicken, you will get fried, ooh
I'm from Chicago where niggas don't live to see 20
But then again I made it out and got a lot of money
I'm 19, I got a couple fucking months left
My birthday December second
So please don't step in my motherfucking direction
'Cause if I feel threatened, I'm upping a Smith & Wesson
I put it to your face, best believe I'ma get it bustin'
I'm spazzing on a track, got an AK like a Russian
I hit you in your head like a motherfucking concussion
I've been causing combustion
Something-ness out of nothing
Twenty-three in my Glock, I said it the last time I was on the Westwood
Twenty-three in my Glock, boy, shooting like Jumpman, Jumpman, uh-huh
I rapped for a hour last time
After that I fucked your bitch in the shower that's fine, huh
I rapped for a hour last time
After that, I fucked your auntie in the shower, that's fine
I fucked your auntie then your mother
Then I put a fucking bullet hole right up in your uncle
I got the fucking ball and I refuse to fucking fumble
I'm confident as fuck, I'm really tired of being humble
These niggas really thinking that they better but they not, though
He say he want beef, I got them shells, let's make some tachos
You know I get, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
He say he want beef, I got them shells, let's make some tacos
He say he get cheese, I get cheese, that shit is not yours
I get cheese like nachos, uh-huh
That chopper on my hip, you run up, I'ma give you quanthro
I shoot through your Monte Carlo, uh, haha
On my shoes is your car note
You get scanned like a bar-code
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 7]
Eminem is like, "I'm cancerous
Diss, you wouldn't want to answer this
Responded back, battle rap, wrote for Canibus"
Shout-out Em, man
Spazz on some of the racks, oh, mm
Pockets fat, you know I got the racks on
Clothes still got the tags on
Boast on a nigga, I'ma brag, um
I'm feeling like the champion
Different approach on this beat
I feel like the best if you askin' me
I'm balling on these hoes like an athlete
I don't think anyone gon' come better after me
Look at the way I spazz, this is off the top, looking like a wave cap Choppa with the mags, shoot you in your ass
Leave you in the past
Memory in the past, now it's getting to the cash
Freestyle flows, I don't write it, nuh-uh
Off the top, tryna kick it and I hope I don't jag
Bad little bitch in the back of a Benz
I'ma probably get behind it and hit it from the back
Gotta tune in and kill shit every day, ho
Pull up on the scene, chopper give you a halo
World in my hands and I treat it like Play-Doh
I love Xbox but I really don't play, ho
I'm on to the next shit, I'm on to the next cash
I'm smoking on the best kush, rollin' the best gas
Pull up in a black Benz, I do not fuck with Jags
You know what's up, nigga
Your bitch gon' fuck, nigga
I'm sippin', lean inside my cup, ain't Robituss', nigga
Ain't with that tussling shit, my chopper tussle for me
I promise you I'm a bully, I keep on getting money
These niggas walk it, they walk it, I told 'em that I run it
I'm kicking it off the dome, that's how a nigga coming
I'm kicking it of the dome, that's how a nigga boming
I'm drinking Henny with pills, you know a nigga vomit
I'm drinking Henny with pills, you know a nigga vomit
Listen to the way I spazz
I'ma kill 'em, put 'em in a body bag, maybe even a body cast
Sick of all the Percocets, where the fuck the molly at?
Ran a train up on your mom, she looking for trolly
Get it popping like it's Tony Hawk, ain't talking 'bout an ollie
Yeah, but I may just pop an ollie
Used to skate in the hallways every Friday
Huh, get it poppin' like an ollie
I remember I was sitting in my basement
Thinking 'bout the clothes that I can't get
Look at me now, I'm up right now
A nigga still got the nerve to say I'm up next
Three times platinum on a song, beat that
I'm the best motherfucker, defeat that
I ain't— hoo
I turned my phone off 'cause I don't really want no motherfuckin' feedback
I got a fucking bad bitch where my feet at
And a bunch of, mm, ha

This is where Juice WRLD roams
I feel like it's my second, uh
I'm the best wit' it, quick witted
I kill niggas, I switch clips
Same way I end sentences, nigga, I'm so relentless
Pull up on the scene, my chopper just like a pencil, lead
Shoot him in the head, motherfucker
A couple times, he gon' be dead, motherfucker
Now his mom calling to the feds, motherfucker
"Look at my son laying in the bed," motherfucker
Ran up in his crib like the repo' man
I gave his bitch wood like a Home Depot, man, huh
Chopper on my hip just like a Pringles can
Desert Eagle on my hip like I'm a Eagles fan
I'm the type to kill all your people, man
I'm not good, hell nah, I'm an evil man
I'm above y'all, we are not equal, man
Before and after, prequel and the sequel, man
I'ma be here for a long ass time
You think you better than me then you lost your mind
I'm Stevie Wonder with it, I will rob you blind
I'm looking for the answers that they can't find
I came to Westwood to spit some facts, motherfucker
I came to Westwood to spit some crack, motherfucker
I came to Westwood to get it back, motherfucker
Your bitch is over here, I hit it like— oof
Your bitch is over here, I hit it like, ooh
I pulled up in a Ghost, peekaboo, the new coupe
You got a problem, that's okay, I got the gun, ooh
Rich nigga, probably could fuck up on the principal
I give a fuck about the principles, gotta seal lock the envelope
I feel like I'm Travis Scott 'cause I'm doper than all the antidote
That bitch is on my dick, I'ma put it in her, you know she trope
I'ma put it in her, you know she choke
I don't got they time for the trolls
I could put that shit up on my soul
Run up on me, chopper hit you in your face like it's over with
I'm sicker than a nigga with a cold and shit
These niggas old as fuck, they got mold and shit
I really wanna give them my condolences
To tell them that it's over and to let the new niggas prosper
How you my father? Nigga, I'm your father
How you my father? Nigga, I'm your father
Sayin' you my father, nigga, why bother?
I don't got no father, nigga, I'm harder without a father
I put that on your daughter
Uh-huh, uh, uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 9]
Uh-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na
That was his flow on this song, right?
*mumbling*
Tour bus full of bottles and models and bitches who swallow
Got guns full of hollows, put you out your sorrow
I'm rappin' on Eminem beats 'cause I follow the leaders
That nigga's a beast
I feel like a monster or maybe a goblin
A straight Jeffrey Dahmer, put dick in your mama
Neck like a ostrich, I'm fly, fuck a copper
Can't judge me at all, put the Johnnie to Cochran
My flow brazy, it's crazy, insane
And the fact that I made it, these fuck niggas hatin' it
I remember playin' this game in my basement
Sayin' I would make it and fuckin' complainin'
Mama on the link, car, food, and the fridge
But we was still strugglin', ballin', triple-doublin'
Damn near had two jobs, tryna keep up
Worked at my school just so I could stay up in there, uh
Now I gotta bless her, now I gotta bless her
Now I gotta fuck on a bitch named Vanessa
Her chest the best, huh, her breasts the best, uh
Now I'm ballin', next up, now I'm ballin', next up
This shit'll upset, I'm fuckin' the world like it's rough sex
Got head from a white bitch, I call it a roughneck
I'm ball on these bitches like Rucker or somethin'
Money makin', rich motherfucker or somethin'
My flow is crazy, it's brazy
I told you, you run up then you will get cranked like a soldier
Make like composers, I promise it's over
Everything but sober, I do her like homework
Niggas think they in it but they not
They been trippin', catch 'em slippin', I'ma shoot 'em with the Glock
I been ballin' like a Piston, shit, I do this shit a lot
All this shit is really all a part of my evil plot
This is world domination, triple 9 in this bitch
Chiropractor with the chopper, break your spine when it hit
I been ballin' like I'm Kobe or LeBron in this bitch
Matter fact, I'm feelin' like I'm in my prime in this bitch
This shit finna do numbers on YouTube, trust me
Hoes gon' love me, they all wanna fuck me
Even if I'm ugly, I know I'm not ugly
I been movin' around too much, trust me
Chopper on my hip with a clover on it, lucky
My chopper like a thotty, I pull it out, it's busting
I really don't got time for none of the discuss-ting
I promise all I'm smoking all this pack, super musty
Off of the dome
This shit comin' off of the dome
And I'm comin' all for your domes
This shit comin' off of the dome
I make hits and take shits on these niggas that think that they better than me, but they not, go figure
Keep the Tommy in my Tommy, lil' nigga, Hilfigers
I'ma ball, I'ma swish, lil' nigga
I remember smoking swishers with my brother and now it's backwoods
Run up on me, chopper hit you and leave you in backwoods
If you lookin' for me then I'm probably up to no good
Runnin' through your hood with probably some more goods
Water whippin' in the kitchen, flippin' it like chicken
Run up, chopper hit him, put him into su-submission
Don't give a fuck about niggas, neither, or bitches
I promise you I'm only focused on gettin' them riches
You see it, believe it, white Justin Bieber
My swag super hot like I caught me a fever
Bring the house down like Queen, no Latifah
You'll get smoked like a blunt, no Khalifa
Boolin' on top with a thot from the block
Give me top, you get hit with the Glock
All my niggas get money, best believe it or not
Run up on me, leave you shot

You Belong To Me LyricsSee the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me

See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain
But remember darling, till you're home again
You belong to meYou might also likeEmbed

Wish You Were Here LyricsThey're not making the skies as blue this year - wish you were here
As blue as they used to when you were near - wish you were here
And the mornings don't seem as new
Brand-new as they did with you
Wish you were here, wish you were here, wish you were here

Someone's painting the leaves all wrong this year - wish you were here
And why did the birds change their song this year - wish you were here
They're not shining the stars as bright
They've stolen the joy from the night
Wish you were here, wish you were here, wish you were here
Someone's painting the leaves all wrong this year - wish you were here
Why did the birds change their song this year - wish you were here

I Went to Your Wedding LyricsI went to your wedding
Although I was dreading
The thought of losing you

The organ was playing
My poor heart kept saying
"Your dreams, your dreams are through"

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness
I uttered a sigh
Whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too

The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness

I uttered a sigh
Then whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Oh, your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too

Kiss of Fire LyricsI touch your lips and all at once, the sparks go flying
Those devil lips that know so well the art of lying
And though I see the danger, still the flame grows higher
I know I must surrender to your kiss of fire

Just like a torch, you set the soul within me burning
I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying
What good is there denying you're all that I desire
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me
Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me
Though it consumes me, your kiss of fire

Since first I kissed you, my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow

Tell me why, why I think of you yet
I know I'll never be free
What has happened to me?

Tell me why, when we danced until three
Tell me why, why my heart couldn't see
I never dreamed of romance
Never gave it a chance

When I think of how you looked that day
In your gown of silk and lace

Tell me why I keep fooling my heart
When I know it was love from the start
Why don't we give it a try?

Where horseshoes are lucky
There's a village smithy standin' under a chestnut tree
Hear the hammer knockin'
See the hammer rockin'
He sings the boogie blues while he's hammerin' on the shoes
See the hot sparks a-flyin'

A Guy Is a Guy LyricsI walked down the street like a good girl should
He followed me down the street like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

I walked to my house like a good girl should
He followed me to my house like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me
I never saw the boy before, so nothing could be sillier
At closer range his face was strange but his manner was familar

So I walked up the stairs like a good girl should
He followed me up the stairs like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

So I walked to my door like a good girl should
He stopped at my door like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

He asked me for a good night kiss
I said it's still good day
I would have told him more except
His lips got in the way

So I talked to my ma like a good girl should
And ma talked to pa like I knew she would
And they all agreed on the married life for me
A guy is a guy wherever ever he may be

So I walked down the aisle like a good girl should
He followed me down the aisle like I knew he would

The Little White Cloud That Cried LyricsI went walking down by the river
Feeling very sad inside
When all at once I saw in the sky
The little white cloud that cried

He told me he was very lonesome
And no one cared if he lived or died
And said sometimes the thunder and lightning
Make all the little clouds hide

He said "Have faith in all kinds of weather
For the sun will always shine
Do your best and always remember
The dark clouds pass with time"
He asked if I'd tell all my world
Just how hard those little clouds try
That's how I know I'll always remember
The little white cloud that sat right down and cried

On this, our wedding day
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
Wait; wait alone
I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
For I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love an' duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearing high noon
He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life for his an'
I'm not afraid of death but, oh, what shall I do
If you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'

Now that I need you by my side

Lead us lest too far we wander
Love's sweet voice is callin' yonder

Hey, there don't get dimmer, dimmer
Light the path below, above

Glow little glow-worm, fly of fire
Glow like an incandescent wire
Glow for the female of the species
Turn on the AC and the DC

Light up you little ol' bug of lightnin'
When you gotta glow, you gotta glow

Swim through the sea of night, little swimmer
Thou aeronautical boll weevil
Illuminate yon woods primeval

See how the shadows deep and darken

Glow little glow-worm, glow

Glow little glow-worm, turn the key on
You are equipped with taillight neon
You've got a cute vest pocket Mazda
Which you can make both slow and faster

It’s In The Book LyricsI have a message for you, a very sad message
My subject for this evening will be
Little Bo Peep
It says here, Little Bo Peep
Who was a little girl
Has lost her sheep
And doesn't know where to find them
Now that's reasonable, isn't it

It's, it's reasonable to assume
If Little Bo Peep had lost her sheep
It's only natural
That she wouldn't know where to find them
That, that basically is reasonable
But, uh, "leave them alone
Now that overwhelms me
Completely overwhelms me
The man said she lost her sheep
Turns right around and boldly states
"She doesn't know where to find them"
And then has the stupid audacity to say
"Leave them alone"
Now, now, now think for a moment, think
If the sheep were lost
And you couldn't find them
You'd have to leave them alone, wouldn't you
So, leave them alone
Leave them alone
It's in the book
Leave them alone and they
They being the sheep, "they will come home"
Ah yes, they'll come home
Oh, there'll be a brighter day tomorrow
They will come home
It's in the book

They will come home a-waggin' their tails
Pray tell me what else could they wag
They will come home a-waggin' their tales
Behind them, behind them
Did we think they'd wag them in front
Of course, they might have come home in reverse
They could have done that, I really don't know
But, none the less
It's in the book

So now if you will, kindly pick up your books
And turn to page 222
We'll ask you all to sing
You'll find your books on the backs of your seats
Are we ready

Everyone, 222
Let's really enjoy ourselves
Let's live it up
All together

Good for everything in the home
And the secret was in the scrubbing
It wouldn't suds and couldn't foam

Then let us all sing right out of grandma's
Of grandma's lye soap
Used for, for everything
Everything on the place
For pots and kettles
The dirty dishes
And for your hands and for your face

Shall we now sing the second verse
Let's get it with great exuberance, let's live it up
It's not raining inside tonight
Everyone, let's have a happy time
Are we ready
All together, the second verse

Little Herman and brother Thurman
Had an aversion to washing their ears
Grandma scrubbed them with the lye soap
And they haven't heard a word in years

Then let us all sing right out of grandma's
Of grandma's lye soap
Sing all out, all over the place
The pots and kettles, the dirty dishes
And also hands and also f.....

Let's have a happy time, everyone
The last verse, al-l-l-l together
Ev-v-v-very one

Mm-m-m-m, thank you kindly, kindly
M-m-mrs, O'Malley, out in the valley
Suffered from ulcers, I understand
She swallowed a cake of grandma's lye soap
Has the cleanest ulcers in the land

Then let us all sing right out of grandma's

Or I'm reciting a poem

Walkin' my baby back home

We stop for a while, she gives me a smile
And cuddles her cheek to my chest
We start into pet and that's when I get

And just when I try to straighten my tie
