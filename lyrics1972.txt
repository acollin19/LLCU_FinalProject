The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face Lyrics[Verse 1]
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the endless skies

[Verse 2]
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
[Verse 3]
And the first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth
And last 'til the end of time, my love

[Outro]
The first time ever I saw your face
Your face

Alone Again (Naturally) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, in a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
"My God that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home"
As I did on my own
[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Verse 2]
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, well who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did He desert me
In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed

[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Bridge]
It seems to me that
There are more hearts
Broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally

[Verse 3]
Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand, why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

[Refrain]
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally23Embed

TranslationsPolskiAmerican Pie Lyrics[Intro]
A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
[Chorus]
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"

[Verse 1]
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock 'n' roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

[Chorus]
I started singin', "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin', "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"

[Verse 3]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
[Chorus]
We started singin', "Bye-bye, Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"

[Verse 4]
Oh, and there we were, all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

[Chorus]
He was singin', "Bye-bye Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die..."

[Breakdown]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

[Chorus]
And they were singin', "Bye-bye Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die"
"This'll be the day that I die"

[Outro]
They were singin', "Bye-bye Miss American Pie"
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', "This'll be the day that I die..."125Embed

Without You Lyrics[Verse 1]
No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

[Verse 2]
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
[Chorus]
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

[Verse 1]
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows

I rode my bicycle past your window last night
I roller skated to your door at daylight
It almost seems like you're avoiding me
I'm okay alone but you got somethin' I need

Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates

You got a brand new key

Daddy, Don’t You Walk So Fast LyricsThe love between the two of us was dying
And it got so bad I knew I had to leave
But halfway down that highway when I turned around I saw
My little daughter running after me
Crying

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Now, it broke my heart to tell my little daughter
That her daddy had to run to catch a train
She had no way of knowin' I was leavin' home for good
I turned around and there she was again
As she said to me

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
My daughter cried, daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast

If only for the sake of my sweet daughter
I just had to turn back home right there and then
And try to start a new life with the mother of my child
I couldn't bear to hear those words again
She cried and said

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
My daughter cried, daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Oh, daddy, don't you walk so fast

Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl) Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

[Verse 2]
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say "Brandy, fetch another round"
She serves them whiskey and wine
[Chorus 1]
The sailors say, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea"

[Verse 3]
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved

[Verse 4]
He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

[Chorus 2]
The sailor said, "Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea"

And loves a man who's not around

(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don’t Want to Be Right LyricsIf loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong doing life
Your mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
Long as I got you by my side
I don't care what your people say
Your friends tell you it's no future
In loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want to
I'll see you when I can
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing I got a wife and two little children
Depending on me too
And am I wrong to hunger
For the gentleness of your touch
Knowing I got somebody else at home
Who needs me just as much
And are you wrong to fall in love
With a married man
And am I wrong trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right

*sick horn break down*

Are you wrong to give your love
To a married man
And am I wrong trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
You might also likeI don't wanna be right
If it means being without you
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping at night

Heart of Gold Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1: Neil Young]
I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold

And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I was slippin' into darkness

You know he loves to drink good whiskey
While Laughing at the moon

Slippin' into darkness
Take my mind beyond the dreams
I was slippin' into darkness
Take my mind beyond the dreams
Where I talk to my brother
Who never said their name

Slippin' into darkness
All my trouble so I choose

Long Cool Woman (In a Black Dress) Lyrics[Intro]
Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sittin' in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman sing a song
A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just-a 5'9, beautiful, tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

[Instrumental Interlude]

I saw her heading to the table
Like a tall walking big black cat
When Charlie said I hope that you're able, boy
Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Then suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

Well the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well I told her don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared
I've gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my living

With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
Yeah, with just one look I was a bad mess
Cause that long cool woman had it all

A Horse With No Name Lyrics[Verse 1]
On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

[Chorus]
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
[Verse 2]
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

[Chorus]
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

Everybody Plays the Fool Lyrics[Intro]
Okay, so you're heartbroken
You sit around mopin'
Crying, crying
You say you're even thinking about dying?
Well, before you do anything rash
Dig this

[Chorus]
Everybody plays the fool sometime
There's no exception to the rule
Listen, baby
It may be factual, may be cruel
I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool
[Verse 1]
Falling in love is such an easy thing to do
And there's no guarantee that the one you love
Is gonna love you

Oh, loving eyes, they cannot see
A certain person could never be
Love runs deeper than any ocean
It clouds your mind with emotion

[Chorus]
Everybody plays the fool sometime
There's no exception to the rule
Listen, baby
It may be factual, may be cruel
I wanna tell you that
Everybody plays the fool

[Verse 2]
How can you help it when the music starts to play
And your ability to reason is swept away

Oh, heaven on earth is all you see
You're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do
Next time around someone cries for you

Washed away the darkness of the lonely night (Lonely night)

Impassioned lovers wrestle as one
Lonely man cries for love and has none

Senior citizens wish they were young
Cold hearted orb that rules the night
Removes the colours from our sight
Red is grey and yellow white

She said, son, please beware
There's this thing called love
And it's everywhere

She told me, it can break your heart
And put you in misery
Since I met this little woman

At least ten times a day
You know, it's so unusual for me
To carry on this way

I'll tell you, I can't sleep at night
Wanting to hold her tight
I've tried so hard to convince myself
That this feeling just can't be right
And I'm telling you

It's too late to turn back now

It's too late to turn back now

You got no place to go
Gotta get out of the city
Why don't you come along with me?
Mighty fine out tonight
Get your girl and hold her tight
We can take it nice and easy
You know it won't be long
'Til we'll be, we'll be
[Chorus]
Down by the lazy river, come as you please
Down by the lazy river, one big family
If you're all alone, you won't be long
Just bring your guitar and sing your song
Down by the lazy river, everybody follow me

[Verse 2]
Better make up your mind
Get the show on the road
We're gonna have a party
Come along or you'll be sorry, sorry
You know there's plenty of room
Come on, sing a-boom-boom-boom
We can get nice and cozy
Why don't you come along and mosey

[Bridge]
On down, I said, down
Come on down, I'm going

[Chorus]
Down by the lazy river, come as you please
Down by the lazy river, one big family
If you're all alone, you won't be long
Just bring your guitar and sing your song
Down by the lazy river, everybody follow me

Sunshine LyricsSunshine, go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking
When he tells me I better get in line
I can't hear what he's saying
When I grow up, I'm gonna make it mine
These ain't dues I been paying
Well, how much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
And he can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine
Sunshine, go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking
Working starts to make me wonder where
Fruits of what I do are going
When he says in love and war, all is fair
He's got cards he ain't showing

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
And he can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine

Sunshine, come on back another day
I promise you I'll be singing
This old world, she's gonna turn around
Brand new bells will be ringingYou might also like2Embed

Starting All Over Again LyricsStarting all over again is gonna be rough, so rough
But we're gonna make it
Starting all over as friends is gonna be rough, on us
But we gotta face it

We lost what we had, that's why it hurt so bad
It set us back a thousand years
We're gonna make it up, though it's gonna be rough
To erase all the hurt and tears

Starting all over again is gonna be hard
But I pray that the love will help us make it
Starting all over again is gonna be slow
But we both know that we can make it
We gotta take life as it comes
And never worry about who's right or wrong
It's an uphill climb to the finish line
We're gonna try to make it one more time

Starting all over again is gonna be rough, so rough
But we're gonna make it
Starting all over as friends is gonna be tough, on us
But we gotta face it

Starting all over again is gonna be hard
But I pray that the love will help us make it
Starting all over again is gonna be slow
We both know that we're gonna make itYou might also likeEmbed

The One Lyrics[Verse 1: Prodigy]
These niggas know the deal, it's easy to get killed
Wet that pussy up, see now you got the chills
Your bright idea shooting at me, the fuck yeah
Bright idea, 'til I blew out his light bulb
I'm more than a hip hop legend, I'm iconic
My sixteen is strong as fuck, I'm bionic
Apparently...you a parody of real nigga shit
Pop your forehead like a zit
I don't fuck with no snitches so I need to know who telling
And I need to know who they told on so I can fact check it
The alpha and omega, Mobb nigga I'm a fixture
Black culture, bougie niggas get they bitch took
Like bad bitches get they body shook
From Jamaica Ave. to the boulevard in Hollywood
From the projects, Nam and Oslo
Rocketman Elton John, call me P-iano
[Hook: Prodigy]
Yeah now I'm on my shit, got me on my shit
I'll hit a nigga with the clipper
And fade a nigga real quick, see
Keep me on my shit, wiling on that shit
I will ruin your life, I promise you that shit

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Swedish features through the window of a Lincoln on the Bell swerving
I felt certain I was born to be the best Earthling
Felt worthless, so many Xs and circles
On my mother neck I know I serve a purpose
Smoke the same shit that turns a normal turtle to a ninja turtle
Neo-ninja doing ? on Myrtle
The motherfucker making a drug look like Urkel
Foreign shooters like Türkoğlu
740 with the curtain and set to 1020 degrees
Eyes closed switching speeds, hitting the weave
I shapeshift to a disease, attack your lung and cripple your knees
R&b chicks are twisted with ease, blitzkrieg
You still posing for your little-league pictures
I'm drinking beer straight out the pitcher
I'll put your moms in an armbar at the bar-mitzvah
Irish linen on the king
I'm guaranteed I'm gonna win another ring

Come with it nigga, get beat the fuck, up
Next to me you're chuck meat
Yeah, we just committed suicide
With this swammi I get busy B; do or die
Big bar champion, the Henny and the rap flow
The great black shark, you just a little mackeral
My bitch appetite for power surpass yours
Now imagine my thoughts while I'm alone and you paused
That's 600 horses stomping on your neck strap
That's me, g-leaning with the pistol on my lap

Morning Has Broken LyricsMorning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the Word

Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from Heaven
Like the first dew fall on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where His feet pass

Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the One Light Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day

The City of New Orleans LyricsRiding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles
Good morning America how are you?
So Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpets made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues

Garden Party Lyrics[Verse 1]
I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
No one recognized me, I didn't look the same

[Chorus]
But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

[Verse 2]
And people came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
An' over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said, hello to "Mary Lou", she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all I sang, I rather drive a truck

Clean Up Woman Lyrics[Verse 1]
A clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Jumpin' slick was my ruin
'Cause, I found out all I was doin'

[Chorus]
Was making it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, oh yeah
Just making it easy for the clean up woman
To get my baby's love, uh-huh, mhm
[Verse 2]
I took this man's love and put it on a shelf
And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
When you needed love I was out having fun
But I found out that all I had done

[Chorus]
Was made it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, uh-huh
Yeah, that's what I did, I made it easy for the clean up woman
To steal my baby's love, oh yeah

[Outro]
The clean up woman will wipe his blues away
She'll give him plenty lovin' 24 hours a day
The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet
She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street
So take a tip, you better get hip
To the clean up woman 'cause she's tough

Though it seems strange to say

In such a mysterious way
And the course of a lifetime runs

On this strange and mournful day
When the mother and child reunion

The Way of Love LyricsWhen you meet a boy
That you like a lot
And you fall in love
But he loves you not

If a flame should start
As you hold him near
Better keep your heart
Out of danger, dear

For the way of love
Is a way of woe
And the day may come
When you'll see him go
Then what will ya do
When he sets you free
Just the way that you
Said goodbye to me

When you meet a boy
That you like a lot
And you fall in love
But he loves you not

If a flame should start
As you hold him near
Better keep your heart
Out of danger, dear

For the way of love
Is a way of woe
And the day may come
When you'll see him go

Then what will ya do
When he sets you free
Just the way that you
Said goodbye to me

Howard at Atlanta LyricsO black boy of Atlanta!
But half was spoken;
The slave’s chains and the master’s
Alike are broken;
The one curse of the races
Held both in tether;
They are rising—all are rising—
The black and white together.
WHITTIER.

SOUTH of the North, yet north of the South, lies the City of a Hundred Hills, peering out from the shadows of the past into the promise of the future. I have seen her in the morning, when the first flush of day had half-roused her; she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of Georgia; then the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys, the tinkle of bell and scream of whistle broke the silence, the rattle and roar of busy life slowly gathered and swelled, until the seething whirl of the city seemed a strange thing in a sleepy land.
Once, they say, even Atlanta slept dull and drowsy at the foot-hills of the Alleghanies, until the iron baptism of war awakened her with its sullen waters, aroused and maddened her, and left her listening to the sea. And the sea cried to the hills and the hills answered the sea, till the city rose like a widow and cast away her weeds, and toiled for her daily bread; toiled steadily, toiled cunningly,—perhaps with some bitterness, with a touch of réclame,—and yet with real earnestness, and real sweat.
It is a hard thing to live haunted by the ghost of an untrue dream; to see the wide vision of empire fade into real ashes and dirt; to feel the pang of the conquered, and yet know that with all the Bad that fell on one black day, something was vanquished that deserved to live, something killed that in justice had not dared to die; to know that with the Right that triumphed, triumphed something of Wrong, something sordid and mean, something less than the broadest and best. All this is bitter hard; and many a man and city and people have found in it excuse for sulking, and brooding, and listless waiting.
Such are not men of the sturdier make; they of Atlanta turned resolutely toward the future; and that future held aloft vistas of purple and gold:—Atlanta, Queen of the cotton kingdom; Atlanta, Gateway to the Land of the Sun; Atlanta, the new Lachesis, spinner of web and woof for the world. So the city crowned her hundred hills with factories, and stored her shops with cunning handiwork, and stretched long iron ways to greet the busy Mercury in his coming. And the Nation talked of her striving.
Perhaps Atlanta was not christened for the winged maiden of dull Boeotia; you know the tale,—how swarthy Atalanta, tall and wild, would marry only him who out-raced her; and how the wily Hippomenes laid three apples of gold in the way. She fled like a shadow, paused, startled over the first apple, but even as he stretched his hand, fled again; hovered over the second, then, slipping from his hot grasp, flew over river, vale, and hill; but as she lingered over the third, his arms fell round her, and looking on each other, the blazing passion of their love profaned the sanctuary of Love, and they were cursed. If Atlanta be not named for Atalanta, she ought to have been.
Atalanta is not the first or the last maiden whom greed of gold has led to defile the temple of Love; and not maids alone, but men in the race of life, sink from the high and generous ideals of youth to the gambler’s code of the Bourse; and in all our Nation’s striving is not the Gospel of Work befouled by the Gospel of Pay? So common is this that one-half think it normal; so unquestioned, that we almost fear to question if the end of racing is not gold, if the aim of man is not rightly to be rich. And if this is the fault of America, how dire a danger lies before a new land and a new city, lest Atlanta, stooping for mere gold, shall find that gold accursed!
It was no maiden’s idle whim that started this hard racing; a fearful wilderness lay about the feet of that city after the War,—feudalism, poverty, the rise of the Third Estate, serfdom, the re-birth of Law and Order, and above and between all, the Veil of Race. How heavy a journey for weary feet! what wings must Atalanta have to flit over all this hollow and hill, through sour wood and sullen water, and by the red waste of sun-baked clay! How fleet must Atalanta be if she will not be tempted by gold to profane the Sanctuary!
The Sanctuary of our fathers has, to be sure, few Gods,—some sneer, “all too few.” There is the thrifty Mercury of New England, Pluto of the North, and Ceres of the West; and there, too, is the half-forgotten Apollo of the South, under whose ægis the maiden ran,—and as she ran she forgot him, even as there in Boeotia Venus was forgot. She forgot the old ideal of the Southern gentleman,—that new-world heir of the grace and courtliness of patrician, knight, and noble; forgot his honor with his foibles, his kindliness with his carelessness, and stooped to apples of gold,—to men busier and sharper, thriftier and more unscrupulous. Golden apples are beautiful—I remember the lawless days of boyhood, when orchards in crimson and gold tempted me over fence and field—and, too, the merchant who has dethroned the planter is no despicable parvenu. Work and wealth are the mighty levers to lift this old new land; thrift and toil and saving are the highways to new hopes and new possibilities; and yet the warning is needed lest the wily Hippomenes tempt Atalanta to thinking that golden apples are the goal of racing, and not mere incidents by the way.
Atlanta must not lead the South to dream of material prosperity as the touchstone of all success; already the fatal might of this idea is beginning to spread; it is replacing the finer type of Southerner with vulgar money-getters; it is burying the sweeter beauties of Southern life beneath pretence and ostentation. For every social ill the panacea of Wealth has been urged,—wealth to overthrow the remains of the slave feudalism; wealth to raise the “cracker” Third Estate; wealth to employ the black serfs, and the prospect of wealth to keep them working; wealth as the end and aim of politics, and as the legal tender for law and order; and, finally, instead of Truth, Beauty, and Goodness, wealth as the ideal of the Public School.
Not only is this true in the world which Atlanta typifies, but it is threatening to be true of a world beneath and beyond that world,—the Black World beyond the Veil. To-day it makes little difference to Atlanta, to the South, what the Negro thinks or dreams or wills. In the soul-life of the land he is to-day, and naturally will long remain, unthought of, half forgotten; and yet when he does come to think and will and do for himself,—and let no man dream that day will never come,—then the part he plays will not be one of sudden learning, but words and thoughts he has been taught to lisp in his race-childhood. To-day the ferment of his striving toward self-realization is to the strife of the white world like a wheel within a wheel: beyond the Veil are smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and the led, of serfdom, of poverty, of order and subordination, and, through all, the Veil of Race. Few know of these problems, few who know notice them; and yet there they are, awaiting student, artist, and seer,—a field for somebody sometime to discover. Hither has the temptation of Hippomenes penetrated; already in this smaller world, which now indirectly and anon directly must influence the larger for good or ill, the habit is forming of interpreting the world in dollars. The old leaders of Negro opinion, in the little groups where there is a Negro social consciousness, are being replaced by new; neither the black preacher nor the black teacher leads as he did two decades ago. Into their places are pushing the farmers and gardeners, the well-paid porters and artisans, the businessmen,—all those with property and money. And with all this change, so curiously parallel to that of the Other-world, goes too the same inevitable change in ideals. The South laments to-day the slow, steady disappearance of a certain type of Negro,—the faithful, courteous slave of other days, with his incorruptible honesty and dignified humility. He is passing away just as surely as the old type of Southern gentleman is passing, and from not dissimilar causes,—the sudden transformation of a fair far-off ideal of Freedom into the hard reality of bread-winning and the consequent deification of Bread.
In the Black World, the Preacher and Teacher embodied once the ideals of this people,—the strife for another and a juster world, the vague dream of righteousness, the mystery of knowing; but to-day the danger is that these ideals, with their simple beauty and weird inspiration, will suddenly sink to a question of cash and a lust for gold. Here stands this black young Atalanta, girding herself for the race that must be run; and if her eyes be still toward the hills and sky as in the days of old, then we may look for noble running; but what if some ruthless or wily or even thoughless Hippomenes lay golden apples before her? What if the Negro people be wooed from a strife for righteousness, from a love of knowing, to regard dollars as the be-all and end-all of life? What if to the Mammonism of America be added the rising Mammonism of the re-born South, and the Mammonism of this South be reinforced by the budding Mammonism of its half-awakened black millions? Whither, then, is the new-world quest of Goodness and Beauty and Truth gone glimmering? Must this, and that fair flower of Freedom which, despite the jeers of latter-day striplings, sprung from our fathers’ blood, must that too degenerate into a dusty quest of gold,—into lawless lust with Hippomenes?

The hundred hills of Atlanta are now all crowned with factories. On one, toward the west, the setting sun throws three buildings in bold relief against the sky. The beauty of the group lies in its simple unity:—a broad lawn of green rising from the red street with mingled roses and peaches; north and south, two plain and stately halls; and in the midst, half hidden in ivy, a larger building, boldly graceful, sparingly decorated, and with one low spire. It is a restful group,—one never looks for more; it is all here, all intelligible. There I live, and there I hear from day to day the low hum of restful life. In winter’s twilight, when the red sun glows, I can see the dark figures pass between the halls to the music of the night-bell. In the morning, when the sun is golden, the clang of the day-bell brings the hurry and laughter of three hundred young hearts from hall and street, and from the busy city below,—children all dark and heavy-haired,—to join their clear young voices in the music of the morning sacrifice. In a half-dozen class-rooms they gather then,—here to follow the love-song of Dido, here to listen to the tale of Troy divine; there to wander among the stars, there to wander among men and nations,—and elsewhere other well-worn ways of knowing this queer world. Nothing new, no time-saving devices,—simply old time-glorified methods of delving for Truth, and searching out the hidden beauties of life, and learning the good of living. The riddle of existence is the college curriculum that was laid before the Pharaohs, that was taught in the groves by Plato, that formed the trivium and quadrivium, and is to-day laid before the freedmen’s sons by Atlanta University. And this course of study will not change; its methods will grow more deft and effectual, its content richer by toil of scholar and sight of seer; but the true college will ever have one goal,—not to earn meat, but to know the end and aim of that life which meat nourishes.
The vision of life that rises before these dark eyes has in it nothing mean or selfish. Not at Oxford or at Leipsic, not at Yale or Columbia, is there an air of higher resolve or more unfettered striving; the determination to realize for men, both black and white, the broadest possibilities of life, to seek the better and the best, to spread with their own hands the Gospel of Sacrifice,—all this is the burden of their talk and dream. Here, amid a wide desert of caste and proscription, amid the heart-hurting slights and jars and vagaries of a deep race-dislike, lies this green oasis, where hot anger cools, and the bitterness of disappointment is sweetened by the springs and breezes of Parnassus; and here men may lie and listen, and learn of a future fuller than the past, and hear the voice of Time:
“Entbehren sollst du, sollst entbehren.”

They made their mistakes, those who planted Fisk and Howard and Atlanta before the smoke of battle had lifted; they made their mistakes, but those mistakes were not the things at which we lately laughed somewhat uproariously. They were right when they sought to found a new educational system upon the University: where, forsooth, shall we ground knowledge save on the broadest and deepest knowledge? The roots of the tree, rather than the leaves, are the sources of its life; and from the dawn of history, from Academus to Cambridge, the culture of the University has been the broad foundation-stone on which is built the kindergarten’s A B C.
But these builders did make a mistake in minimizing the gravity of the problem before them; in thinking it a matter of years and decades; in therefore building quickly and laying their foundation carelessly, and lowering the standard of knowing, until they had scattered haphazard through the South some dozen poorly equipped high schools and miscalled them universities. They forgot, too, just as their successors are forgetting, the rule of inequality:—that of the million black youth, some were fitted to know and some to dig; that some had the talent and capacity of university men, and some the talent and capacity of blacksmiths; and that true training meant neither that all should be college men nor all artisans, but that the one should be made a missionary of culture to an untaught people, and the other a free workman among serfs. And to seek to make the blacksmith a scholar is almost as silly as the more modern scheme of making the scholar a blacksmith; almost, but not quite.

The function of the university is not simply to teach bread-winning, or to furnish teachers for the public schools, or to be a centre of polite society; it is, above all, to be the organ of that fine adjustment between real life and the growing knowledge of life, an adjustment which forms the secret of civilization. Such an institution the South of to-day sorely needs. She has religion, earnest, bigoted:—religion that on both sides the Veil often omits the sixth, seventh, and eighth commandments, but substitutes a dozen supplementary ones. She has, as Atlanta shows, growing thrift and love of toil; but she lacks that broad knowledge of what the world knows and knew of human living and doing, which she may apply to the thousand problems of real life to-day confronting her. The need of the South is knowledge and culture,—not in dainty limited quantity, as before the war, but in broad busy abundance in the world of work; and until she has this, not all the Apples of Hesperides, be they golden and bejewelled, can save her from the curse of the Boeotian lovers.
The Wings of Atalanta are the coming universities of the South. They alone can bear the maiden past the temptation of golden fruit. They will not guide her flying feet away from the cotton and gold; for—ah, thoughtful Hippomenes!—do not the apples lie in the very Way of Life? But they will guide her over and beyond them, and leave her kneeling in the Sanctuary of Truth and Freedom and broad Humanity, virgin and undefiled. Sadly did the Old South err in human education, despising the education of the masses, and niggardly in the support of colleges. Her ancient university foundations dwindled and withered under the foul breath of slavery; and even since the war they have fought a failing fight for life in the tainted air of social unrest and commercial selfishness, stunted by the death of criticism, and starving for lack of broadly cultured men. And if this is the white South’s need and danger, how much heavier the danger and need of the freedmen’s sons! how pressing here the need of broad ideals and true culture, the conservation of soul from sordid aims and petty passions! Let us build the Southern university—William and Mary, Trinity, Georgia, Texas, Tulane, Vanderbilt, and the others—fit to live; let us build, too, the Negro universities:—Fisk, whose foundation was ever broad; Howard, at the heart of the Nation; Atlanta at Atlanta, whose ideal of scholarship has been held above the temptation of numbers. Why not here, and perhaps elsewhere, plant deeply and for all time centres of learning and living, colleges that yearly would send into the life of the South a few white men and a few black men of broad culture, catholic tolerance, and trained ability, joining their hands to other hands, and giving to this squabble of the Races a decent and dignified peace?
Patience, Humility, Manners, and Taste, common schools and kindergartens, industrial and technical schools, literature and tolerance,—all these spring from knowledge and culture, the children of the university. So must men and nations build, not otherwise, not upside down.

Teach workers to work,—a wise saying; wise when applied to German boys and American girls; wiser when said of Negro boys, for they have less knowledge of working and none to teach them. Teach thinkers to think,—a needed knowledge in a day of loose and careless logic; and they whose lot is gravest must have the carefulest training to think aright. If these things are so, how foolish to ask what is the best education for one or seven or sixty million souls! shall we teach them trades, or train them in liberal arts? Neither and both: teach the workers to work and the thinkers to think; make carpenters of carpenters, and philosophers of philosophers, and fops of fools. Nor can we pause here. We are training not isolated men but a living group of men,—nay, a group within a group. And the final product of our training must be neither a psychologist nor a brickmason, but a man. And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living,—not sordid money-getting, not apples of gold. The worker must work for the glory of his handiwork, not simply for pay; the thinker must think for truth, not for fame. And all this is gained only by human strife and longing; by ceaseless training and education; by founding Right on righteousness and Truth on the unhampered search for Truth; by founding the common school on the university, and the industrial school on the common school; and weaving thus a system, not a distortion, and bringing a birth, not an abortion. 19

When night falls on the City of a Hundred Hills, a wind gathers itself from the seas and comes murmuring westward. And at its bidding, the smoke of the drowsy factories sweeps down upon the mighty city and covers it like a pall, while yonder at the University the stars twinkle above Stone Hall. And they say that yon gray mist is the tunic of Atalanta pausing over her golden apples. Fly, my maiden, fly, for yonder comes Hippomenes!Embed

Puppy Love Lyrics[Verse 1:]
And they called it puppy love
Oh, I guess they'll never know
How the young heart really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're in our teens
Tell them all
Please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream
[Verse 2:]
I cry each night
My tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll be back
(You’ll be back)
In my arms once again
(You’ll be back in my arms once again)

[Verse 3:]
Someone help me
Help me
Help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I
Oh, how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love

Someone help me
Help me
Help me please
Is the answer up above?
How can I
Oh, how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love

You Don’t Mess Around with Jim Lyrics[Verse 1]
Uptown got its hustlers
The bowery got its bums
42nd Street got Big Jim Walker
He's a pool-shootin' son of a gun
Yeah, he big and dumb as a man can come
But he stronger than a country hoss
And when the bad folks all get together at night
You know they all call big Jim "Boss", just because
And they say
[Chorus]
"You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim"

[Verse 2]
Well outta south Alabama come a country boy
He said, "I'm lookin' for a man named Jim
I am a pool-shootin' boy, my name's Willie McCoy
But down at home they call me Slim
Yeah I'm lookin' for the king of 42nd Street
He drivin' a drop top Cadillac
Last week he took all my money, and it may sound funny
But I come to get my money back"
And everybody say, "Jack don't you know

[Chorus]
You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim"

[Verse 3]
Well, a hush fell over the pool room
Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
And when the cuttin' was done
The only part that wasn't bloody
Was the soles of the big man's feet, ooh
And he was cut in about a hundred places
And he was shot in a couple more
And you better believe
They sung a different kind of story
When big Jim hit the floor now, they say

Yeah, big Jim got his hat
Find out where it's at
And it's not hustlin' people strange to you
Even if you do got a two-piece custom-made pool cue

[Chorus]
Yeah you don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger

Hot Rod Lincoln LyricsMy pappy said, "Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln."

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all
It's got overdrive, just won't stall
With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
The brakes are good, tires fair

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said, "Boys, that's a mark for me!"
By then the taillight was all you could see

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, "Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots."
You might also likeTook a corner; sideswiped a truck
Crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, "Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!"
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin'
And down in the dips she started to rockin'
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail
And called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said, "Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!"1Embed

A Cowboy’s Work Is Never Done LyricsRide, I used to jump my horse and ride
I had a six gun at my side
I was so handsome, women cried
And I got shot but never died
I could play, if I do every thing he'd say
Girls just seem to get in his way
Those days we weren't considered fun
A cowboy's work is never done

He'd fight crime all the time
He'd always win
Till his mom would break it up
And call him in
He was tough he was hard
But he was kind
But he was love, cause guys like him
Were hard to find
Ride, I like to ride again some day
I think I still know how to play
I'd play games now but it's not fun

Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’ LyricsWhenever I chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smiling face
Anytime and any place
And everytime they ask me why
I just smile and say

You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home
Well people may try to guess
The secret of a happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing

The secret i'm speaking of
Is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song
That i always sing

You've got to
Kiss an angel good morning
And let you know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil when you get back home

Troglodyte (Cave Man) Lyrics(Intro)
Yeah, I know what you're talkin' about
Uhh
There was a time when man did live in caves as we all know
These people were known as cave men, neanderthal men or troglodytes

What we're gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time
When the only people that existed were troglodytes... cave men...
Cave women... Neanderthal... troglodytes. Let's take the average
Cave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up
Try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this:
"Dance... dance". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look
In the mirror: "Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a
Woman gotta find a woman". He'd go down to the lake where all the
Woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look
Around and just reach in and grab one. "Come here... come here"
He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause
It might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd
Be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there
Wet and frightened. He said: "Move... move". She got up. She was a
Big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one
Of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said:
"Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me
Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!". She looked down on him
She was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said
(Falsetto):
"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy". He said: "Wha?". She said (falsetto):
"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy". You know what he said? He started it way
Back then. I wouldn't lie to you. When she said (falsetto)
"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy" he said "Right on! Right on! Hotpants!

Strange as it might seem

Possessed by the devil's skew
From her shack near the swampland
Made of mud-pie brick
Marie stirred her witch's brew

Voodoo of any kind
She had potions and lotions
Herbs and tanna leaves
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Early one morning, into murky swamp dew
Vanished Marie with hate in her eyes
Though she'll never return
All the Cajuns knew
A witch queen never dies

Taxi Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was raining hard in Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light

[Verse 2]
Oh, where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain
She just looked out the window
She said, "Sixteen Parkside Lane"
[Verse 3]
Something about her was familiar
I could swear I seen her face before
But she said, "I'm sure you're mistaken"
And she didn't say anything more

[Verse 4]
It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
Then she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile just the same

[Chorus]
And she said, "How are you, Harry?"
I said, "How are you, Sue?
Through the too many miles and the too little smiles
I still remember you"

[Verse 5]
It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of a Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far

[Chorus]
You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
I took off to find the sky

Over 'til my time (Over 'til my time) runs out

[Bridge]
Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
'Cause she's dying, aren't we all?

[Verse 6]
There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine-trimmed lawns

[Verse 7]
And she said, "We must get together"
But I knew it'd never be arranged
Then she hand me twenty dollars for a two-fifty fare
She said, "Harry, keep the change"
[Verse 8]
Well, another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go
I stashed the bill in my shirt

[Chorus]
And she walked away in silence
It's strange how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago

[Verse 9]
You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
I took off for the sky

And here she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips and getting stoned
I go flying so high when I'm stoned3Embed

Dont Say You Dont Remember LyricsWe wrote on the corner of the table:
"This is the only one that will last
For you, for me, for always
Forever was meant for us", but for us it went by too fast
Don't say you don't remember
I'll never love anyone else
If you say you don't remember
How can I go on living
(How can I go on living)
With myself?
When we meet you always call me "baby."
How could it be that you forgot my name?
Before you go, be honest
I belonged to you and believed that you felt the same
Don't say you don't remember
I'll never love anyone else
If you say you don't remember
How can I go on living
(How can I go on living)
With myself?
People never stay the same forever
Somebody always loves a little more
Tonight I need to love you
Together we'll find a way to make tomorrow worth living for

Sealed with a Kiss LyricsThough we've got to say
Goodbye for the summer
Baby, I promise you this
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

Yes, it's gonna be a
Cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But baby, you won't be there

I don't wanna say
Goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
So, let us make a pledge
To meet in September
And seal it with a kiss

Yes, it's gonna be a
Cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss

I Saw the Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was late last night
I was feeling something wasn't right
There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you

[Verse 2]
So we walked along
Though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me, oh so strong
About you
[Chorus 1]
Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light
In your eyes (In your eyes)
In your eyes (In your eyes)

[Verse 3]
Though we had our fling (We had our fling)
I just never would suspect a thing (Suspect a thing)
'Til that little bell began to ring (Began to ring)
In my head, in my head

[Verse 4]
But I tried to run (I tried to run)
Though I knew it wouldn't help me none (Not help me none)
'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
Or so I said

[Chorus 2]
But my feelings for you
Were just something I never knew
'Til I saw the light
In your eyes (In your eyes)
In your eyes (In your eyes)

But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest
'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest

But I won't do it anymore
Can't you see the light in my eyes (In my eyes)

Motorcycle Mama LyricsTell your daddy and your mama too
You got something better to do
Than stick around the house the rest of your life
You're eighteen you can do what you like

You'll be the queen of my highway, my motorcycle mama
And we'll see the world from my Harley

We'll get matching jackets and helmets too
We'll get respect from the towns we ride through
We'll sleep at the roadside in the soft green grass
And if the squares walk by, we'll let them pass
You'll be the queen of my highway, my motorcycle mama
And we'll see the world from my Harley

And maybe in a year or two
We'll have a little one, she'll look just like you
We'll add on a sidecar
Electric guitar
And we'll be a trio
The baby makes three, oh

Tell your daddy and your mama too
You got something better to do
Than stick around the house the rest of your life
You're eighteen you can be my wife

You'll be the queen of my highway, my motorcycle mama
And we'll see the world from my Harley
And we'll see the world from my Harley
And we'll see the world from my Harley, if the chain don't breakYou might also likeEmbed

Roundabout Lyrics[Instrumental Intro 00:00-00:59]

[Verse 1]
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out-and-out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley

[Verse 2]
The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley
[Chorus]
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers, we'll be there and laughing, too
Twenty-four before my love, you'll see I'll be there with you

[Verse 3]
I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distant atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound and even in the valley

[Chorus]
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers, we'll be there and laughing, too
Twenty-four before my love, you'll see I'll be there with you
[Middle-Eight]
Along the drifting cloud, the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind, the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand
Go closer, hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time, a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears, we stand surrounded by a million years
I'll be the roundabout, the words will make you out-and-out
I'll be the roundabout, the words will make you out-and-out

Doctor My Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

[Chorus]
Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?
[Verse 2]
'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

[Chorus]
Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

[Chorus]
Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize
For having learned how not to cry?See Jackson Browne LiveGet tickets as low as $69You might also like4Embed

Take It Back Lyrics[Sample]
On the firing line... lock, one round load
Ready on the right? Ready on the left?
Ready on the firing line? Watch for your targets

[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah
Yeah
Pay attention

[Verse 1: Raekwon & Inspectah Deck]
Welcome to the fish fry where niggas get burnt to a crisp
Jump out the pot—"Yeah, yo, I got this"
Long armor, construction's on, I'm pro-drama
Catch me in the wildest beefs, I bring bombers
Bearded like Talibans, booted, my black ninjas'll come through
Tuxedos on with the gold llamas
Priceless like emeralds, check out the ski mask
King Tut's nephew gave it to me for three bags of heron
Don Baron, sniff a bag of blow
Fifth out, running up in Saks with the ill army
Shake feds, play dead—"Yo, check out what Rae said"
Lay on ya hands, let the Branson break bread
High energy, all my niggas are kin to me
Regardless how it go down, I still get ten a ki'
Beware of my enemies, y'all remember me
Nikes with the low goose on, and I been a beast
Wilding in my headphones, red in my stones (Uh-huh)
Good ganja out, if I die fill up my headstones
With water, dough, acid and gold classics
All my niggas who pump, the spirit'll jump out and grab shit
Max with the laser on 'em, staircase caskets
Broke bugged thugs in the hallway maxing
[Interlude: Inspectah Deck & Sample]
Still them 1-6-Ooh niggas
Straight up
Whoa, hold up, hold up

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
The nozzle aim rip through ya frame for pocket change
Fiend for the Rush Hour 4 then pop a vein
Thousand-dollar corks pop, pause or get off top
Used to be a general, just lost your spot
"Animal House," two grand'll handle your mouth
Beast mode with the G-Code, cancel 'em out
Son, I've seen Hell, fell into the palms of Satan arms
Don that I am, made 'em bow in the face of God
Graveyard-shifting, different day, the same thing
The name ring, then, the chain swing, and dames cling
Money green, Maury kicks, whips and new fitteds
("It was all a dream") Advocated by the few who do live it
Bloomberg make a nigga cop the Mausberg
Shorty ain't a shorty, he a shooter like Wahlberg
Old man told me, "Don't be blind to deception
Only strive for perfection homey, your mind is a weapon"

[Interlude: Sample]
Relax
You got your muscles tight
Relax

Kick back the boards, six thousand a week
Pay homage, what the don beat, you're a minor threat
I see your sweat roll down your cheek
And you're soft and sweet, your talk is pork
Get murdered in New York when I enforce the heat
And the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
Bring back the life that you thought was lifeless
The way of the gun, son, who the nicest?
S.K., no stun gun, smooth devices
"Time Crisis," I played the game, low lifers
In a brawl, rip the phones out the walls in Rikers
Vipers in the infirmary rooms with slicers
Shiesters with hate in their blood might bite you
Fuck that bitch if your wife don't write you
Cancel her, buy another one just like her
Pipers in the bucket of ice taste righteous
Today's mathematics when we build in cyphers
The baby automatic kill like Air Force strikers
I'm still Asiatic when I spill the hypeness

And you know you're not talkin' to the air, to the air
And the world will look better from up there

Speak to the sky 'cause things can get ya down

Or if the road I'm on seems awful hard to find
And though my conversation doesn't always rhyme
I always try to find some time to .......
Speak to the sky and tell you how I feel
And to know sometimes what I say ain't right

Cause I speak to the sky every night

And if I stumble and it seems that I am blind
Or if the road I'm on seems awful hard to find
