Here I stand, watching the tide go out
So all alone and blue
Just dreaming dreams of you
I watched your ship as it sailed out to sea
Taking all my dreams
And taking all of me
The sighing of the waves
The wailing of the wind
The tears in my eyes burn
Pleading, "My love, return"
Why, oh, why must I go on like this?
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore?
The sighing of the waves
The wailing of the wind
The tears in my eyes burn
Pleading, "My love, return"
Why, oh, why must I go on like this?
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore?

I Can’t Stop Loving You Lyrics[Chorus]
I can't stop loving you, I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays, dreams of yesterday

[Verse 1]
Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart, yeah
[Chorus]
I can't stop loving you, I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays

[Verse 2]
Those happy hours (Those happy hours)
That we once knew (That we once knew)
Though long ago (Though long ago)
Still make me blue (Still make me blue)
They say that time (They say that time)
Heals a broken heart (Heals a broken heart)
But time has stood still (Time has stood still)
Since we've been apart (Since we've been apart)

[Chorus]
I can't stop loving you, I said I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times, sing the song to me
I can't stop wanting you, it's useless to say
So I'll just live my life of dreams of yesterdays, of yesterdaysYou might also like2Embed

Roses Are Red (My Love) Lyrics[Intro]
Roses are red, my love
Du-du-du-du

[Verse 1]
A long, long time ago
On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way

[Chorus]
Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you
[Verse 2]
We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name

[Chorus]
Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you

[Verse 3]
Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter dear
And I wrote back to you

[Refrain]
Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
Good luck may God bless you

Is that your little girl?
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write

A swingin' place called Palisades Park
To have some fun and see what I could see
That's where the girls are

That girl I sat beside was awful cute
After we stopped she was holdin' hands with me

Down like a roller coaster
Back like a loop-the-loop
And around like a merry-go-round

We danced around to a rockin' band
And when I could I gave that girl a hug

When I fell in love

Breaking Up Is Hard to Do LyricsYou tell me that you're leaving
I can't believe it's true
Girl, there's just no living
Without you

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
Cause if you go then I'll be blue
Breaking up is hard to do

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do
[Chorus]
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know, I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up, I wish that we were making up again

Wolverton Mountain LyricsThey say don't go on Wolverton Mountain
If you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clowers has a pretty young daughter
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should enter there

All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain
I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain
Though Clifton Clowers, he might take my life
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should wander there

I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain
It's too lonesome down here below
It's just not right to hide his daughter
From the one who loves her so

Her tender lips are sweeter than honey
And Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clowers
If a stranger should wander there

I don't care about Clifton Clowers
I'm gonna climb up on his mountain
I'm gonna take the girl I love

But when I see you passing by

You broke my heart and set me free

Stillness in the grove
Not a rustling sound
Softly shines the moon clear and bright
Dear, if you could know
How I treasure so
This most beautiful Moscow Night
Lazily the brook like a silvery stream
Ripples in the light of the moon
And a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Yes a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Dearest, why so sad, why the downcast eyes
And your lovely head bent so low
Oh, I mustn't speak, though I'd love to say
That you've stolen my heart away
Promise me my love, as the dawn appears
And the darkness turns into light
That you'll cherish dear, through the passing years
This most beautiful Moscow Night
Say you'll cherish dear through the passing years

Here they have a lot of fun
Putting trouble on the run

He goes on the prowl each night
Like an alley cat
Looking for some new delight
Like an alley cat

She can't trust him out of sight
There's no doubt of that
He just don't know wrong from right
Like an alley cat

He meets them
And loves them
And leaves them
Like that "Catsanova" does

That's no way to treat a pal
She should tell him "Scat!"
Aren't you sorry for that gal
And her alley cat?

He meets them
And loves them
And leaves them
Like that "Catsanova" does

He don't know what faithful means
There's no doubt of that
He's too busy makin' scenes
Like an alley cat

And that's the sad, sad tale of a lonesome quail
And her alley cat.

Three stars will shine tonight, one for the lonely
That star will shine its light each time that someone sighs
Three stars for all to see, one for young lovers
That star was made to be the sparkle in their eyes
And, for the third star, only one reason
A star you can wish on to make dreams come true
High in the sky above, three stars are shining
I hope that star of love will shine down on you
And, for the third star, only one reason

Cut and slash, sharpest knife, it won't die
Poison cup, drank it up, it won't die

'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
Ain't gonna spend another night in your bed, in your bed
Laws of man, are just pretend, they ain't mine
Love so good, love so bad, it won't die
Some talk too long, they know it all, I just smile and move on
Words ain't free like you and me, I don't mind
Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel?

You better come home Speedy Gonzales
Away from tannery row
Stop all of your drinking

Come on home to your adobe
And slap some mud on the wall!
The roof is leaking like a strainer
There's loads of roaches in the

Your doggie's gonna have a puppy
And we're running out of Coke
No enchiladas in the icebox
And the television's broke
I saw some lipstick on your sweatshirt
I smell some perfume in your ear
Well, if you're gonna keep on messin'
Don't bring your business back a-here

A Little Bitty Tear LyricsA little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

You said you were leaving tomorrow
That today was our last day
I said there'd be no sorrow, that I'd laugh when you walked away

A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

I said I'd laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have another waiting
And I'd wave goodbye as you go
A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

Everything went like a planned it
And really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
Till you walked with your *grip* through the door
A little bitty tear let me down, spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, but a little bitty tear let me down

Crying in the Rain LyricsI'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurtin' me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All my sorrow and pain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you so
Though the heartaches remain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
Rain drops fallin' from heaven
Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Some day when my cryin's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll
Never see me complain
I'll do my cryin' in the rain

I'll do my cryin' in the rain
I'll do my cryin' in the rainYou might also likeEmbed

Al di là LyricsAl di la means you are far above me, very far
Al di la, as distant as the lovely evening star
Where you walk flowers bloom
When you smile all the gloom turns to sunshine
And my heart opens wide
When you're gone it fades inside and seems to have died
Al di la
I wondered as I drifted where you were
Al di la
The fog around me lifted
There you were
In the kiss that I gave was the love I had saved for a lifetime
Then I knew all of you was completely mineYou might also likeEmbed

You Don’t Know Me Lyrics[Intro]
You don't love me
You don't know me

[Verse]
You give your hand to me and then you say, "Hello"
And I can hardly speak, my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell, you think you know me well
Well, you don't know me (No, you don't know me)
No, you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
Oh, I'm just a friend, that's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me (No, you don't know me)
[Chorus]
Oh, I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too (Love me too)

[Post-Chorus]
You give your hand to me and then you say, "Goodbye"
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh, to never, never know the one who loved you so
Well, you don't know me

Oh, I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by

Ahab the Arab LyricsLet me tell you 'bout Ahab The Arab
The Sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just dripping off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hands

He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And every evening about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde...and ride

Spoken
Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils, swingingest grade "A" number one U.S. choice dancer in the Sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had a thing going. You know, and they'd been carrying on for some time now behind the Sultan's back and you could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert air and he'd say (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, "stop, Clyde!" and Clyde would say, (imitate camel voice). Which is camel for, "What the heck did he say anyway?"
Well....

He brought that camel to a screeching halt
At the rear of Fatima's tent jumped off Clyde
Snuck around the corner and into the tent he went
There he saw Fatima laying on a Zebra skin rug
Wearing rings on her fingers and bells on her toes
And a bone in her nose ho, ho
Spoken

There she was friends lying there in all her radiant beauty. Eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate, bowl of chitterlings, two bananas, three Hershey bars, sipping on a "R C" Co-Cola listening to her transistor, watching the Grand Ole Opry on the tube reading the Mad magazine while she sung, "Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?" and Ahab walked up to her and he said, (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, "Let's twist again like we did last summer, baby." (laughter) You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug, give him one of the sly looks, she said, (coy, girlish laugh) "Crazy baby"
'Round and around and around and around...etc

(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance LyricsWhen Liberty Valance rode to town
The women folk would hide, they'd hide
When Liberty Valance walked around
The men would step aside

Because the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shooting, straight and fast
He was mighty good

From out of the east a stranger came
A law book in his hand, a man
The kind of a man the West would need
To tame a troubled land
'Cause the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When it came to shooting, straight and fast
He was mighty good

Many a man would face his gun and many a man would fall
The man who shot Liberty Valance
He shot Liberty Valance
He was the bravest of them all

The love of a girl can make a man
Stay on when he should go, stay on
Just trying to build a peaceful life
Where love is free to grow

But the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When the final showdown came to pass
A law book was no good

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd
Return that fateful night, ah, that night
When nothing she said could keep
Her man from going out to fight

From the moment a girl gets to be full grown
The very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other
Only one returns

Gotta write a song from my heart, then pick the greatest work of art
Tie them with a ribbon made of gold and give them to Cindy

You Beat Me to the Punch Lyrics[Verse 1]
That day, I first saw you passing by
I wanted to know your name but I was much too shy
But I was looking at you so hard
Until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me my name

You beat me to the punch that time
You beat me to the punch
You beat me to the punch

After I had known you for it seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you, would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours

[Chorus 1]
You beat me to the punch that time
You beat me to the punch
You beat me to the punch

[Bridge]
Since I love you, I thought you would be true and love me tender
So I let my heart surrender - to you, yes, I did
But I found out beyond a doubt one day, boy, you were a playboy
Who would go away and leave me - blue

[Verse 3]
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very day

Uptown LyricsHe gets up each morning and he goes downtown
Where everyone's his boss and he's lost in an angry land
He's a little man

But then he comes uptown each evening to my tenement
Uptown where folks don't have to pay much rent
And when he's there with me he can see that he's everything
Then he's tall, he don't crawl, he's a king

Downtown he's just one of a million guys
He don't get no breaks and he takes all they got to give
'Cause he's got to live
But then he comes uptown where he can hold his head up high
Uptown he knows that I am standing by

Everybody Loves Me But You LyricsWhy did I listen to my friends
When they told me what to do
Yes, I still have my friends
But I don't have you
And like true friends, they still come around
And say, "I'm sorry you're blue"
Oh, everybody loves me but you

My friends don't know what they've done
Wwell, they wouldn't understand anyhow
I can't tell them they were wrong
'Cause I'm afraid they'll leave me, too
Now it's funny but more than ever
I need them now
I still ask my friends what to do
But it seems they don't know
How to bring
How to bring you back
They say, "what made him go?"
Yes, like true friends, they still come around
And say, "I'm sorry you're blue"
Oh, everybody loves me but youYou might also like1Embed

Patches LyricsDown by the river that flows by the coal yards
Stand wooden houses with shutters torn down
There lives a girl everybody calls Patches
Patches, my darling, of Old Shanty town

We planned to marry when June brought the summer
I couldn't wait to make Patches my bride
Now I don't see how that ever can happen
My folks say "No" and my heart breaks inside

Patches, oh what can I do
I swear I'll always love you
But a girl from that place
Would just bring me disgrace
So my folks won't let me love you
Each night I cry as I think of that shanty
And pretty Patches there watching the door
She dosn't know that I can't come to see her
Patches must think that I love her no more

I hear a neighbour telling my father
He says a girl name of Patches was found
Floating face down in that dirty old river
That flows by the coal yards in Old Shanty Town

Patches, oh what can I do
I swear I'll always love you
It may not be right
But I'll join you tonight
Patches I'm coming to youYou might also likeEmbed

Venus In Blue Jeans LyricsShe's Venus in blue jeans
Mona Lisa with a pony tail
She's a walking talking work of art
She's the girl who stole my heart

My Venus in blue jeans
Is the Cinderella I adore
She's my very special angel too
A fairy tale come true

They say there's 7 wonders in the world
But what they say is out of date
There's more than 7 wonders in the world
I just met number 8
My Venus in blue jeans
Is everything I hoped she be
A teenage goddess from above
And she belongs to me

Teenage Idol LyricsSome people call me a teenage idol
Some people say they envy me
I guess they got no way of knowing
How lonesome I can be

I need somebody to be my baby
Someone to tell my troubles to
I got no time to ever find her
'Cause I'm just passing through

I travel around from town to lonely town
I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
If I find fortune and fame
And lots of people know my name
That won't mean a thing if I'm all alone
I got no rest when I'm feeling weary
I got to pack my bags and go
I got to be somewhere tomorrow
To smile and do my show

I travel around from town to lonely town
I guess I'll always be just a rolling stone
If I find fortune and fame
And lots of people know my name

Old Rivers Lyrics(Words and music by Crofford)

How old was I when I first seen old Rivers?
I can't remember when he weren't around
Well, that old fellow did a heap of work
Spent his whole life walking plowed ground

He had a one-room shack not far from us
And well, we was about as poor as him
He had one old mule he called Midnight
And I'd trailed along after them
He used to plow them rows straight and deep
And I'd come along near behind
A-bustin' up clods with my own bare feet
Old Rivers was a friend of mine

That sun'd get high and that mule would work
Till old Rivers'd say, Whoa!
He'd wipe his brow, lean back on the reins
And talk about a place he was gonna go

Chorus:
He'd say, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there amoung the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow

--- Instrumental ---

I got a letter today from the folks back home and
They're all fine and crops is dry
Down at the end my mama said, Son
You know old Rivers died

Just sittin' here now on this new-plowed earth
Trying to find me a little shade
With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule, old Rivers and me

P.T. 109 LyricsIn '43 they put to sea thirteen men and Kennedy
Aboard the PT 109 to fight the brazen enemy
And off the isle of Olasana in the straight beyond Naru
A Jap destroyer in the night cut the 109 in two
Smoke and fire upon the sea everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan yeah they thought had the best of a mighty good man

And on the coast of Kolombangara looking through this telescope
Australian Evans saw the battle for the crew had little hope
Two were dead and some were wounded all were clinging to the bow
Fightin' fire and flightin' water trying to save themselves somehow
Smoke and fire upon the sea...
McMahon the Irishman was burned so badly he couldn't swim
Leave me here go on he said cause if you don't we'll all be dead
The PT skipper couldn't leave him a man to die alone at sea
And with a strap between his teeth he towed the Irishman through the sea
Smoke and fire upon the sea...
[ flute ]
He led his men through waters dark rocky reefs and hungry sharks
He braved the enemy's bayonets a thirty eight hung round his neck
Four more days and four more nights a rescue boat pulled into sight
The PT 109 was gone but Kennedy and his crew lived on
Now who could guess who could possibly know that same man named Kennedy
Would be the leader of the nation be the one to take command
The PT 109 was gone but Kennedy lived to fight again
Smoke and fire upon the sea everywhere they looked was the enemy
But JFK and his crew lived on
Which proves it's hard to get the best of a man named John

Holly came from Miami F.L.A
Hitch-hiked her way across the U.S.A
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her leg and then he was a she
She says, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
Said, "Hey honey, take a walk on the wild side "
Candy came from out on the island
In the back room she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was given head
She says, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
Said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
And the colored girls go
Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo

Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York city is the place where
They said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
I Said, "Hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side"
Sugar plum fairy came and hit the streets
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should have seen him go go go
They said, "Hey Sugar, take a walk on the wild side"
I said, "Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side"
All right, huh
Jackie is just speedin' away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would have helped that dash

(Girls, Girls, Girls) Were Made To Love LyricsMy father looked at me one day, said Son, it's plain to see
That you're getting older and should have a talk with me
You'll soon be going on lots of dates as to a man you grow
And there's one important thing every boy should know
And that is
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
That's why some have eyes of blue
That's why some stand five foot two
Cause girls, girls, girls were made to love
One day soon you'll have a date and you'll take her home that night
Then you'll find you'll wonder Would a kiss be right?
The more you look, the more you'll find those doubts will fill your head
But think real hard and you might recall what your old Dad said
He said that
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
That's why ya watch em walk down the street
That's why their kisses taste awful sweet
Cause girls, girls, girls were made to love
Then you'll meet that special girl wholl sweep your offa your feet
You'll want to say you love her but you'll find it hard to speak
This is a time when you'll find it's better left unsaid
Just tell er like I've told your Mom, with a kiss instead
Girls, girls, girls were made to love

Town Without Pity Lyrics[Verse 1]
When you're young and so in love as we
And bewildered by the world we see
Why do people hurt us so?
Only those in love could know
What a town without pity can do

If we stop to gaze upon a star
People talk about how bad we are
Ours is not an easy age
We're like tigers in a cage
What a town without pity can do
[Chorus]
The young have problems
Many problems
We need an understanding heart
Why don't they help us?
Try to help us
Before this clay and granite planet falls apart!

[Verse 2]
Take these eager lips and hold me fast
I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last
How can we keep love alive?
How can anything survive
When these little minds tear you in two?
What a town without pity can do

Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
(Come on on safari with me)

[Verse 1]
Early in the morning we'll be starting out
Some honeys will be coming along
We're loading up our Woody
With our boards inside
And heading out singing our song
[Chorus 2]
Come on (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
Come along (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me

[Chorus 1]
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
(Come on on safari with me)

[Verse 2]
At Huntington and Malibu
They're shooting the pier
At Rincon they're walking the nose
We're going on safari to the islands this year
So if you're coming get ready to go

[Chorus 2]
Come on (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
Come along (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me

[Chorus 1]
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
(Come on on safari with me)

They're angling in Laguna in Cerro Azul
They're kicking out in Doheny too
I tell you surfing's mighty wild
It's getting bigger every day
From Hawaii to the shores of Peru

[Chorus 2]
Come on (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
Come along (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes, I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me

[Chorus 1]
Let's go surfing now
Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
(Come on on safari with me)

[Outro]
With me
