Wheel of Fortune LyricsThe wheel of fortune
Goes spinning around
Will the arrow point my way?
Will this be my day?

Oh, wheel of fortune
Please don't pass me by
Let me know the magic of
A kiss and a sigh

While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning
I'll not dream of winning
Fortune or fame
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning
I'll be yearning, yearning
For love's precious flame
Oh, wheel of fortune
I'm hoping somehow
If you'll ever smile on me
Please let it be now

While the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning
I'll not dream of winning
Fortune or even fame
While the wheel is turning, turning, turning
I'll be yearning, yearning
For love's precious flame

Oh, wheel of fortune
I'm hoping somehow
If you ever smile on me
Please let it be nowYou might also likeEmbed

Ooh-wah
Ooh-wah
Ooh-wah

If your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
It's no secret you'll feel better if you cry
When waking from a bad dream
Don't you sometimes think it's real?
But it's only false emotions that you feel

If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go on and cry
If your heartaches seem to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting bluer with each song
Well, now, remember sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go right on, baby, and cry
(Go on and cry)

You Belong To Me LyricsSee the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me

See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain
But remember darling, till you're home again
You belong to meYou might also likeEmbed

Wish You Were Here LyricsThey're not making the skies as blue this year - wish you were here
As blue as they used to when you were near - wish you were here
And the mornings don't seem as new
Brand-new as they did with you
Wish you were here, wish you were here, wish you were here

Someone's painting the leaves all wrong this year - wish you were here
And why did the birds change their song this year - wish you were here
They're not shining the stars as bright
They've stolen the joy from the night
Wish you were here, wish you were here, wish you were here
Someone's painting the leaves all wrong this year - wish you were here

I Went to Your Wedding LyricsI went to your wedding
Although I was dreading
The thought of losing you

The organ was playing
My poor heart kept saying
"Your dreams, your dreams are through"

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness
I uttered a sigh
Whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too

The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness

I uttered a sigh
Then whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Oh, your mother was crying
Your father was crying

Kiss of Fire LyricsI touch your lips and all at once, the sparks go flying
Those devil lips that know so well the art of lying
And though I see the danger, still the flame grows higher
I know I must surrender to your kiss of fire

Just like a torch, you set the soul within me burning
I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying
What good is there denying you're all that I desire
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me
Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me
Though it consumes me, your kiss of fire

Since first I kissed you, my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me
Though it consumes me

Tell Me Why LyricsTell me why, though I try to forget
Tell me why, why I think of you yet
I know I'll never be free
What has happened to me?

Tell me why, when we danced until three
Tell me why, why my heart couldn't see
I never dreamed of romance
Never gave it a chance

When I think of how you looked that day
In your gown of silk and lace

Tell me why I keep fooling my heart
When I know it was love from the start
Why don't we give it a try?

Blacksmith Blues LyricsDown in old Kentucky
Where horseshoes are lucky
There's a village smithy standin' under a chestnut tree
Hear the hammer knockin'
See the hammer rockin'
He sings the boogie blues while he's hammerin' on the shoes
See the hot sparks a-flyin'
Like Fourth of July-in'

A Guy Is a Guy LyricsI walked down the street like a good girl should
He followed me down the street like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

I walked to my house like a good girl should
He followed me to my house like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me
I never saw the boy before, so nothing could be sillier
At closer range his face was strange but his manner was familar

So I walked up the stairs like a good girl should
He followed me up the stairs like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

So I walked to my door like a good girl should
He stopped at my door like I knew he would

Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be
So listen while I tell you what this fellow did to me

He asked me for a good night kiss
I said it's still good day
I would have told him more except
His lips got in the way

So I talked to my ma like a good girl should
And ma talked to pa like I knew she would
And they all agreed on the married life for me
A guy is a guy wherever ever he may be

So I walked down the aisle like a good girl should
He followed me down the aisle like I knew he would

The Little White Cloud That Cried LyricsI went walking down by the river
Feeling very sad inside
When all at once I saw in the sky
The little white cloud that cried

He told me he was very lonesome
And no one cared if he lived or died
And said sometimes the thunder and lightning
Make all the little clouds hide

He said "Have faith in all kinds of weather
For the sun will always shine
Do your best and always remember
The dark clouds pass with time"
He asked if I'd tell all my world
Just how hard those little clouds try
That's how I know I'll always remember
The little white cloud that sat right down and cried

High Noon LyricsDo not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
On this, our wedding day
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
Wait; wait alone
I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
For I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love an' duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearing high noon
He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life for his an'
I'm not afraid of death but, oh, what shall I do
If you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'

Now that I need you by my side

Lead us lest too far we wander
Love's sweet voice is callin' yonder

Glow for the female of the species
Turn on the AC and the DC

Swim through the sea of night, little swimmer
Thou aeronautical boll weevil
Illuminate yon woods primeval

Glow little glow-worm, glow

You've got a cute vest pocket Mazda
Which you can make both slow and faster

It’s In The Book LyricsI have a message for you, a very sad message
My subject for this evening will be
Little Bo Peep
It says here, Little Bo Peep
Who was a little girl
Has lost her sheep
And doesn't know where to find them
Now that's reasonable, isn't it

It's, it's reasonable to assume
If Little Bo Peep had lost her sheep
It's only natural
That she wouldn't know where to find them
That, that basically is reasonable
But, uh, "leave them alone
Now that overwhelms me
Completely overwhelms me
The man said she lost her sheep
Turns right around and boldly states
"She doesn't know where to find them"
And then has the stupid audacity to say
"Leave them alone"
Now, now, now think for a moment, think
If the sheep were lost
And you couldn't find them
You'd have to leave them alone, wouldn't you
So, leave them alone
Leave them alone
It's in the book
Leave them alone and they
They being the sheep, "they will come home"
Ah yes, they'll come home
Oh, there'll be a brighter day tomorrow
They will come home
It's in the book

They will come home a-waggin' their tails
Pray tell me what else could they wag
They will come home a-waggin' their tales
Behind them, behind them
Did we think they'd wag them in front
Of course, they might have come home in reverse
They could have done that, I really don't know
But, none the less
It's in the book

So now if you will, kindly pick up your books
And turn to page 222
We'll ask you all to sing
You'll find your books on the backs of your seats
Are we ready

Everyone, 222
Let's really enjoy ourselves
Let's live it up
All together

Good for everything in the home
And the secret was in the scrubbing
It wouldn't suds and couldn't foam

Then let us all sing right out of grandma's
Of grandma's lye soap
Used for, for everything
Everything on the place
For pots and kettles
The dirty dishes
And for your hands and for your face

Shall we now sing the second verse
Let's get it with great exuberance, let's live it up
It's not raining inside tonight
Everyone, let's have a happy time
Are we ready
All together, the second verse

Little Herman and brother Thurman
Had an aversion to washing their ears
Grandma scrubbed them with the lye soap
And they haven't heard a word in years

Then let us all sing right out of grandma's
Of grandma's lye soap
Sing all out, all over the place
The pots and kettles, the dirty dishes
And also hands and also f.....

The last verse, al-l-l-l together
Ev-v-v-very one

Mm-m-m-m, thank you kindly, kindly
M-m-mrs, O'Malley, out in the valley
Suffered from ulcers, I understand
She swallowed a cake of grandma's lye soap
Has the cleanest ulcers in the land

And cuddles her cheek to my chest
