How You Remind Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
Tired of livin' like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me

[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

[Verse 2]
It's not like you didn't know that
I said, "I love you," and I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause livin' with me must have damn near killed you

And this is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Post-Chorus]
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no
Yet, yet, yet, no, no

[Bridge]
Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealin'
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me
[Pre-Chorus]
This is how you remind me of what I really am
This is how you remind me of what I really am

[Chorus]
It's not like you to say sorry
I was waitin' on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you a heart worth breakin'
And I've been wrong, I've been down
Been to the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream, "Are we havin' fun yet?"

[Outro]
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yet, yet, are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head scream)
Are we havin' fun yet?
Yeah, yeah (These five words in my head)

Ashanti

[Chorus]
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I don't know why you're treating me so bad (Treat me so bad)
You said you love me, no one above me and I was all you had (All you had)
And though my heart is beating for you, I can't stop crying
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay

[Chorus]
See, my days are cold without you (Without you)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (Oh, whoa)
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you (Keep on running back to you)

I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears after all these years

[Verse 3]
Ooh, I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad what love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
To all of my ladies (Ladies)
Feel me, come on, sing with me

[Bridge]
See, when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to appreciate me
Then it all remains the same
That you ain't never gonna change
(Never gonna change, never gonna change)
[Chorus]
See, my days are cold without you (My days are cold, baby)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more (No more, no more)
I keep on running back to you
See, my days are cold without you (Without you)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more (No more, no more)
I keep on running back to you

[Outro]
Baby, why you hurt me, leave me and desert me?
Boy, I gave you all my heart and all you did was tear it up
Looking out my window, knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags, this something always holds me back26Embed

Wherever You Will Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Verse 2]
And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

[Pre-Chorus]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

[Verse 3]
I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Outro]
If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go30Embed

Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day

Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
(You) You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone (Oh yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else

Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied, without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

[Verse 2]
You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

[Chorus]
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face

[Verse 3]
Everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
'Cause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

And you could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I will save you from all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

[Chorus]
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

[Bridge]
No-nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Told you when to run away
Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Showed you when to run away
[Chorus]
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
Well, you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
No, this pain you gave to me

This pain you gave to me

[Outro]
Can you take it all, can you take it all away?
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?

When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me
One-on-one but you become

You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryna be cool, you look like a fool to me, tell me

Always on Time Lyrics[Intro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call (Buckshots, ha), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

[Chorus: Usher]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, all mine
I need a girl in my life

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Yo, I'm internationally known on the microphone
I got it all, but I really need a wife at home
I don't really like the zone, never spend the night alone
I got a few you would like to bone but
Chicks that romance me don't tickle my fancy
Only Tiffany, Nancy, that's not where my plans be
Need a girl that could stand me, raise me a family
Go from trips to Delancey to trips to the Grammy's 'cause
Most of these girls be confusin' me
I don't know if they really love me or they usin' me
Maybe it's the money or maybe you ain't used to me?
'Cause you was depressed and now you abusin' me
That's why I need me a girl that be true to me
Know 'bout the game and know how it do to me
Without a girl on my side, shit'll ruin me
Forget the world, girl, it's you and me
Now let's ride

[Chorus: Usher]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride with me)
I need a girl to make my wife
(I need a girl who makes me feel so good inside)
I need a girl who’s mine, all mine
I need a girl in my life (Whoa, ride)
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Right here with me)
I need a girl to be my wife
(I need a girl who makes me feel so good inside)
Nobody else, she’s all mine
I need a girl in my life

[Verse 2: Loon]
Yo, now I done met a lot of women in my lifetime
But see it's not a lot of women that got the right mind
I done had pretty chicks with all the right features
And hood rat chicks that only rock sneakers
Cellphones and beepers and know how to treat ya
You break her heart, she'll walk out and leave ya
I find a girl, I'ma keep her
'Cause now I'm gettin' money and the game gettin' deeper
Yo, on some real shit, I need somebody I could chill with (Let's chill)
I need somebody I could build with
I need somebody I could hold tight
Winter time in a full-length Snow White
Anytime we together feel so right (So right)
You the girl I been lookin' for my whole life
God, bless me, I'm glad I got the insight
Because of you, girl, now I understand life
I need a girl (I need a girl)

[Chorus: Usher]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride with me)
I need a girl to make my wife (My wife)
I need a girl who’s mine, all mine

I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Oh, ride)
I need a girl to be my wife (My wife)
Nobody else, she’s all mine (Yeah)
I need a girl in my life

[Verse 3: Diddy]
I had a girl that would've died for me
Didn't 'preciate her so I made her cry for me
Every night she had tears in her eyes for me
Caught a case, shorty took the whole ride for me
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl, we was like brothers
All night we would play fight under covers
Now you gone, can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And how we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn, I wish you would've had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy's style
Shit is wild
All them days that I reminisce
About the way I use to kiss them pretty lips
But as long as you happy, I'ma tell you this
I love you girl and you're the one that I will always miss
I love you, yeah

[Chorus: Usher]
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, all mine (Mine, all mine)
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife
Nobody else, she's all mine (All mine)
I need a girl in my life (Girl, you mean so much to me)
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride, ride)
I need a girl to make my wife
I need a girl who's mine, all mine (All mine)
I need a girl in my life (I just want you to be my baby)
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride
I need a girl to be my wife (I just need you to be my wife)
Nobody else, she's all mine (I just want you)
I need a girl in my life
I need a girl to ride, ride, ride (Ride, ride, ride)
I need a girl to make my wife (Girl, you make me feel so good inside)

I Need A Girl (Pt. 2)
[Intro: Diddy, Ginuwine & Mario Winans]
Yeah, is that bounce right here
Time to move on, time to be strong
Don't stop now, straight to the top now
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a manThis is what I need

[Verse 1: Diddy & Ginuwine]
Girl, you made me believe again
If you happy, then be with him
Go 'head, mami, breathe again, go 'head, mami, breathe again
Don't stop now straight to the top now
Go 'head, mami, make it hot now
I need me a love that's 'gon make my heart stop now
And what I need is simple, five foot five with dimples
Potential wife credentials
Know about the life I'm into, life I've been through
And how I had a triflin' mental
So ride with me, G Force fly with me
Times get hard, cry with me, die with me
White beach sands, lie with me
My advice is forget the limelight
Let's make love, while we listen to Frank White
(This is what I need) So tight, now I understand life

[Chorus: Ginuwine with Mario Winans, & P. Diddy]
What I need (Yeah, take that), oh, baby
Is a pretty woman next to me (A pretty woman, yeah, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (Dream with me, believe in me)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family, baby)
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need

[Verse 2: Loon with Mario Winans & Diddy]
Listen to me now, what should I say now? Come on ma
Been a whole day, now I wanna lay 'round
And sip coladas, dipped in Prada
I'm smooth as Erik Estrada, dipped in dollars
We out in Vegas Nevada, bubble bath in the champagne glass
'Bout the size of a campaign ad
You don't know how you look to me
But if love was a crime you be a crook to me
'Cause mami, I done been around the world
Seen a lot of places
Been around your girl, believe I read faces
I can tell she don't want me to prevail
But I, learn my lesson watchin' Sean stressin'
So why listen to her and start guessin'?
Mami, you ain't ready to ride then start dressin'
I need a girl to receive my mom's blessin'
Confession, my love no contestin'
I need affection
Yes, I need affection, let's go Mario

[Bridge: Mario Winans]
Girl, what the hell is on your mind?
I could be dumb but I'm not blind
There's something leaking in your mind
Don't look to good for you and me
Always getting weak
That ain't what I need, baby

[Chorus: Mario Winans with Ginuwine]
Is a pretty woman next to me (Oh, please, baby)
To share the dreams that I believe (I need a girl in my life)
Maybe we could start a family (Start a family baby)
Someone who truly understands
How to treat a man (How to treat a man)
This is what I need

[Verse 3: Diddy]
Ayo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as were here, then we might as well shine together
Never mind the weather, go somewhere and get our minds together
Build a love that'll last forever
So let's stop the pain, stop the rain
Put stress to rest girl, stop the games
Name the spot, mami, I got the plane
Roll through rough, I got the Range
Ma, I got some thangs, known to put rocks in rings
Pushing hundred foot yachts and thangs
Your man don't play, have you ever been to Saint-Tropez
Or seen a brotha play a Mandolay?
Girl I wanna just look in your eyes and watch the sun rise
No more lies, no more tears to cry
No more reasons for leavin', you I believe in
Love you 'til the day I stop breathing
I love you, girl

[Outro: Mario Winans & Ginuwine]
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
A pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah, oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
This is what I need baby
Is a pretty woman next to me
Standing next to me
To share the dreams that I believe
When I wake up in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face, baby
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah, oh yeah
This is what I need
Is a pretty woman next to me

Hello my friend, we meet again
It's been a while, where should we begin?
Feels like forever
Within my heart are memories
Of perfect love that you gave to me
Oh I remember

When you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh, how quickly life can turn around
In an instant
It feels so good to reunite
Within yourself and within your mind
Let's find peace there

Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes

Round the outside, round the outside

Round the outside, round the outside

Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?

Guess who's back
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more; they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me, so
Come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits, and get ready
'Cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, "Attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

I wanted to be like you
I wanted everything
So I tried to be like you
And I got swept away
I didn't know that it was so cold
And you needed someone to show you the way
So I took your hand and we figured out that
When the tide comes, I'd take you away

I can take you away from here
So lonely inside
So busy out there
And all you wanted was somebody who cares

So hurry, hold me
Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on
Please, can you tell me?

I’m Gonna Be Alright (Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & (Nas)]
Oh yes
(Uh, this for you, girl)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo' hand
All I know, when Nas was yo' man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'
[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part

Could I expect so much from you?

Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat (Said I'm gonna be alright)
I'm slow caught
[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it

Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty words (Hey baby)

Never win first place, I don't support the team
I can't take direction, and my socks are never clean
Teachers dated me, my parents hated me
I was always in a fight, 'cause I can't do nothing right

Oops (Oh My) Lyrics[Verse 1: Tweet]
Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance
From his body, so buttery brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook, I had to catch my breath

[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?
[Verse 2: Tweet]
I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride
Let it ride and partied
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left; a reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my (Oh my)
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

[Bridge: Missy Elliott & (Tweet)]
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was looking so good, I couldn't reject myself
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was feeling so good, I had to touch myself
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was eyeing my thighs, butter pecan brown
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, comin' outta my shirt and then my skirt came down

A Moment Like This Lyrics[Verse 1]
What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now

[Chorus]
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
[Verse 2]
Everything changes, but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreamin', but 'til I awake
Can we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share

[Chorus]
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this

Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall (Fall)
So let me tell you this

Addictive Lyrics[Verse 1 - Rakim]
You off the planet, wherever you at you stand out
Plus you specialize in freakin your man out
Put it all in one pot lets see if it pan out
Stick ya hand out, I got it all planned out
Layin out the way, I set a date to wed on
Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She fiending till I'm in her arms, I'm King
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit
Victoria's Secret set on
Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandalous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic
Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict

[Verse 2: Truth Hurts]
He breaks me down, he builds me up
He fills my cup, I like it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes in late, but it's okay
He do, I do, he knows the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on his team, he keeps me clean
And gives me things, he makes me scream

[Hook: Truth Hurts]
He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessing, spontaneous
He's so persuasive and I'm his lady

[Verse 3: Truth Hurts]
Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted

No Such Thing Lyrics[Verse 1]
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

[Pre-Chorus]
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
[Chorus]
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

[Verse 2]
So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats, grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books, but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories, tiny tragedies

[Pre-Chorus]
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

[Chorus]
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

Superman (It’s Not Easy) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
I'm just out to find
The better part of me

I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane
I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

I wish that I could cry
Fall upon my knees
Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd, but don't be naive
Even heroes have the right to bleed
I may be disturbed, but won’t you concede
Even heroes have the right to dream
And it's not easy to be me

Up, up, and away, away from me
Well, it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Diggin' for kryptonite on this one way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Lookin' for special things inside of me

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you

I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!

Never thought that we would ever be more than friends

I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed
'Cause when we kissed, the moment after, I looked at you different, yeah

Killin one from the top of the stash and I'm feelin buns

Dances around, she struts with the "fuck" walk
Touches her toes, and she can make her butt talk

And tell momma get a mink, baby girl let's ride (That's right)

And go straight to the mall and tear down the inside
Prada, Gucci, full-mink leather (Leather)
Burberry's cool, Coogi sweater (Sweater)
Twenty inches, pop my feather
The Birdman daddy, I fly in any weather
Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-wagon is so fly
Number one, don't tangle and twist it
When it come to these cars I am that nigga
The g-uh-g-uh-Gucci with the matchin' interior
Three-wheel ride with the tire in the middle
It's Fresh and Stunna, and we like brothers
We shine like paint, daddy, it's our summer

Turn around and sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steerin' wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma, player's where you can find me
Cruisin' through the parkin' lot on twenty-fours
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (Turn left)
Where your wife really love me 'cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (Skrtt)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, (Uh uh) boy can you top that
I'ma show you some shit, rookie, press that button
The trunk went "uh-uh", and all of a sudden
Four 15's, didn't see no wires
And then I heard (Boom) from the amplifiers

Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp, (Ho-ho-hood rich) I stay shive

Impala loud pipes, drinkin' the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man, I'll do it again
In a Cadillac truck twenty-fours with tens
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Six bad broads flyin' in at nine
New Suburban truck with the porno showin'
Up and down and up they goin'
Bodies on the Roadster, Lexus, you know what
That hard-top Bimmer, yo Ma, that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly
430 Lex with the convertible top
And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a Superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shive, I stay shive
Can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent

A Woman’s Worth Lyrics[Verse 1]
You could buy me diamonds, you could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world

Dinner lit by candles, run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last
(Baby, you know I'm worth it)

If you treat me fairly, I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
(Baby, I know you're worth it)
If you never play me, promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
('Cause baby, I know you're worth it)

[Pre-Chorus]
She walks the mile, makes you smile, all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

7 Days Lyrics[Intro]
You know what?
Got something to say
Craig David
7 days
Check it out, yeah

[Verse 1]
On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (Oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body (Body)
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine
[Pre-Chorus]
Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd, "Love to rendezvous"
She asked me, "What we were gonna do?"
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moet for two

[Chorus]
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

[Verse 2]
Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it
(Back she flipped it, the way she kicked it)
And I, oh-oh, I, yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (Ooh, yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (Ooh, yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl, hmm, you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat 'for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing off my phone
When you're feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me

[Chorus]
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

[Bridge]
(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh, yeah
I can't get her off my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you, oh
[Chorus]
Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday, we chilled on Sunday

I fuck the crowd up — that's what I do
Young and successful — a sex symbol
Now bitches want me to fuck 'em — true, true
Hold up, wait up, shorty
Oh what's up, getting my dick sucked, what are you doing?
Besides minding my fuckin' business
Trying to get my paper, child support suing
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fucking TV's and the jewelry bitch, tell me that
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'ma tell you like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus

We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out

Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggas

Can’t Fight the Moonlight Lyrics[Verse 1]
Under a lover's sky
Gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall
Well, just wait until
'Til the sun goes down

[Pre-Chorus]
Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling, so right
It will steal your heart tonight
[Chorus]
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart

[Verse 2]
There's no escaping love
Once a gentle breeze
Weaves its spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won't be too long (not too long)
'Til you're in my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm, so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight

[Chorus]
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you can't
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it

But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

[Verse 1]
Here's how it goes
You and me, up and down

I'm not gonna beg you to stay

You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

It was good (It was good), it was bad, but it was real
And that's all you have in the end, our love mattered

[Chorus]
If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay (I won't beg you to stay)

Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not

What About Us? Lyrics[Intro: Darkchild]
Woo!
Yeah, Darkchild
Uh, B-Rocka
Let's go

[Verse 1: Brandy]
Why don't you return my calls?
Why you trip 'bout where I be?
You don't ever come to see me
You say that you're too busy (what?)
What the hell? I don't have time
Why you messin' with my mind?
I can find another guy
Someone who will treat me right
[Pre-Chorus: Brandy]
I don't need this bull-ish
I won't put up with it any longer
You can go if you want
I don't need your pity
I will be just fine
If you decide that you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what

[Chorus: Brandy & (Darkchild)]
What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the eyes that you gave?
What about all of the things you told me?
What about all of the things that you said?
What about all of the promises that you made?
What about all of the eyes that you gave?
What about, what about, what about us? (What about it?)
What about us? (And what about it?)
What about us? (Uh, what about it?)
What about us? (What about us, uh?)

[Verse 2: Brandy]
Thought you said you were different
Was that what I heard you say?
Said that you'd love only me
Thought that you'd be all I need (what?)
What happened to promises?
Said that you were a better man
Your words have no weight with me
Cause you're counterfeit, I see

Baby, check it out, hear this
Now, what if I said that you wasn't fit to be with?
Now, what if I told you the game we played, I picked it?
Now, what if I said it wasn't true, so do you?
You and I know, without me there's no you
So what about bills that were passed due, paid for you?
And all you said to me is, "Baby, I owe you"
Forget about the brand-new life that I gave you
Don't "what about us?" to me, 'cause we are through
(Don't "what about us?" to me, what about us?)
[Chorus: Brandy & (Darkchild)]
What about all of the things that you said? (What about em?)
What about all of the promises that you made? (Woo!)

Underneath Your Clothes Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're a song
Written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
[Verse 2]
'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a, ah, ah

[Bridge]
I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
You know it's true
Oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling

Since you came in, I knew back then

Without you right here having my back

If I Could Go Lyrics[Intro: Lil' Mo & Angie Martinez]
Yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Yeah
Uh, woo! come on, uh
If I can go, with you
Yo, yo, uh
[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can choose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is
[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby, vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby, vamos, we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario]
I hear you, yeah, talk to me
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
In Croix, you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
Employed, with the block since around '94, boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Holdin' dat dough after the studio, I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario, the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin', get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin; it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols (Come on)
'Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week - back to you

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
(Tell me, oh)
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby, vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow

Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin?
We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?
And a seat, know why? The window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few
Go 'head
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?
Nothin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue
And the shop's there?
If they don't got em, they don't make em (True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's okay, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask
[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all

"Okay, here we go..."
Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside and you're all alone
All alone, yeah!

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down

And the whole world loves it when you make that sound

Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought he could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall; crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole-whole world-world...

Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss

Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre

Underneath It All Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me
Like no one else
And behind your dark glasses
You're something else

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely
[Verse 2]
You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

[Chorus]
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

Stumbling back next to me

Ven aqui, Ven aqui Mama
Baby girl don't you know you're a star
We could take a little trip to mi casa
Spend the night popping cris in the hot tub
See I ain't never seen no girl like you
Every sexy little thing you do
5'5' brown eyes with your thick thighs
Every time I see your smile its got me hypnotized
[Verse 3: Eve]
I keep 'em mesmerized, listen to me closely
E-V-E is how a thorough bred supposed to be
Hate the thirsty type, can't even get close to me
That's why I got my own stack, Daddy, how it's supposed to be
I ain't about the game, playin' and gift chasin'
All in frontin' Daddy please, we both big facin'
All the things I want, I got, forget me not
Just from my stance, why you starin' at me? Got you hot
Not too many bitches like her, one of a kind
I mean even the bitches like her, she just a dime
Not impressed by your Cris' poppin' 'cause if you would
I might end, of the night we gone be lip locking
But only if I choose to, I don't fall in love easily
Give you the blues Boo, I have you sittin'
'Round misty-eyed Caramel, get 'em all the time
Hot shit from City High

[Chorus: Claudette (Ryan)]
Anywhere I go I'm spotted
(Fo' real and that's no question)
And anything I want I got it
(No frontin' and no guessin')
5' 5" with brown eyes
(Caramel complexion)
Smile like the sunrise
(Body like heaven)

'Cause anywhere I go I'm spotted
(Fo' real and that's no question)
And anything I want I got it
(No frontin' and no guessin')
5' 5" with brown eyes

Smile like the sunrise

Luv U Better Lyrics[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
'Cause lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, "You make me sick"
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
'Cause I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct
[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
'Cause I been imaginin' more ways
I’m gon' luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I’m gon' luv U better

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don’t say no
'Cause I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know

Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do

[Bridge: LL Cool J & Pharrell Williams]
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
It’s a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin’ you foul names
Actin’ like females is all the same
I’m gon’ love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I’ll never be the same
I’ma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you’re back in my life
But this time I’ma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin’s gonna tear us apart, promise
[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways

Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do

Gone Lyrics[Verse 1: Justin]
There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

[Pre-Chorus 1: Justin with All]
Was it something I said
To make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold?
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now
[Chorus: All & Justin]
I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face (touch your face)
But the truth remains, you're

[Post-Chorus: Justin & All]
Gone
You're gone
Baby, you're gone
Girl, you're gone
Baby girl, you're gone
You're gone
You're

[Verse 2: Justin with All]
Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone
No, no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
The time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
(Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my every day (you)
But baby, I don't want to

So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do

You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do
Yeah hey, hey, hey yeah

[Chorus: All & Justin]
I've been sitting here (sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
(My best to be a man and be strong)
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
(Wishing I could touch your face)
But the truth remains, you're
(Truth remains, you're)

Gone
You're gone
You're gone

What will I do
If I can't be with you?
Tell me where will I turn to?
Baby, who will I be?
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart?
Baby, why don't you see
That I need you here with me?
Oh... oh

I've been sitting here (sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind

Before it's all over, I'ma meat this chick
Probably treat this chick, mo' betta
Cause if you ain't - know, thugs and ladies go together
Poppin' my collar, patnah - who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot; and the mug and the watch ugly
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me cause they don't trust me
And they say I'm lucky; you think I got time

From, prissy women to women who go to shadows
But you know, the Rule be livin' it up

Laugh when you cryin', cry when you laughin
But ain't nothing happenin', a girl got a little uptight

But, you ain't on the low with that freaky thing you do

Where'd you get that matchin' Benz with them windows tinted?
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin' through?
Man, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues, breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag? What you got in that bag?
A couple of cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job of just eyein' me, spyin' me

Man, that car don't come out until next year, where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty thousand bucks gone, where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back 'cause you got money to the ceilin'
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin', the better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin', winnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'
Now, who's that bucked naked cook fixin' three course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps when her body taps the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of raps, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose

Are you custom made, custom paid, or you just custom fitted?
PlayStation 2 up in the ride, is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips, touchin' lips to the top of the dick and then, "Whew"
Now, tell me who's your housekeeper, and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?

You wouldn't be around
Or maybe I like the stress

But that was long ago
I don't wanna cry no more

Days Go By Lyrics[Verse 1]
You
You
You are still a whisper on my lips
A feeling at my fingertips
That's pulling at my skin
You leave me when I'm at my worst
A feeling as if I've been cursed
Bitter cold within

A feeling at my fingertips
That's pulling at my skin
You leave me when I'm at my worst
A feeling as if I've been cursed
Bitter cold within

Baby Lyrics[Intro]
I don't remember feeling like this
Baby
Baby, I love you
Baby
Baby, I love you

[Verse 1]
I got this jones forming in my bones (From a man)
Who indeed took over my soul (Understand)
I couldn't breathe if he ever said (He would leave)
Get on my knees 'til they bloody red (Baby, please)
See, I don't know if you get it yet (Just don't know)
He's like a lighter to my cigarette (Watch me smoke)
I never knew another human life (Didn't know)
Could have the power to take over mine
So baby, baby
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me saying
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2]
See, I could never feel alone with you (In my life)
I'll give up everything I own for you (Won't think twice)
Almost a shame how I'm mesmerized (Such a shame)
I lose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why)
Because your kisses make my lips quiver (And that's real)
And when you touch me, my whole body shivers (I can feel)
Now, I can see how another life ('Nother life)
Could have the power to take over mine
'Cause you're my...

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me saying
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (Baby, I love you)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby, I can't see my world (I can't see)
Living here on God's green earth (God)
You don't know what you've done to me (Done to me)
I never thought I'd need you desperately (Desperately)
It's kind of sick how I'm stuck on you (Stuck on you)
But I don't care 'cause I'm needing you (I'm needing you)
And how I feel will remain the same (Remains the same)
'Cause you're my baby ('Cause you're my baby)

[Verse 3]
Listen, and when the world starts to stress me out (Where I run)
It's to you, boy, without a doubt (You're the one)
Who keeps me sane and I can't complain (Can't complain)
You're like a drug, you relieve my pain (May seem strange)
You're like the blood flowing through my veins (Ooh)
Keeps me alive and feeding my brain (Ooh)
Now this is how another human life ('Nother life)
Could have the power to take over mine
'Cause you're my...

The Good Stuff Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
Of a corner bar, and it just seemed right so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
But he walked up, and said, "What'll it be?"
I said, "The good stuff"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said "You can't find that here"
[Chorus 1]
'Cause it's the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff

[Verse 2]
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said, "I'll have some of that"
We sat there and talked as an hour passed, like old friends
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, "That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He said, "Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new T-shirt saying, "I'm a Grandpa"
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff"

He said, "When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says, "I'm sorry," say, "So am I"

And drink it up

Drive (For Daddy Gene) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides"
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

[Chorus]
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say "A little slower son, you're doing just fine"
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say
You might also like[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say "Turn it left" and "Steer it right"
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric chokeEmbed

Standing Still Lyrics[Verse 1]
Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights
Trying to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here  to the twilight
There's a dead end to my left, there's a burning bush to my right
You aren't in sight
You aren't in sight

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you want me
Like I want you?
[Chorus]
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?
Or am I standing still?
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by?

[Verse 2]
Mothers on the stoop, boys in souped-up coupes on this hot summer night
Between fight and flight, is the blind man's sight and a choice that's right
I roll the window down, feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town
Feel broken down, ah
I feel broken down

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you need me
Like I need you?

Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?

Full Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Boy, I saw you soon as you came bouncin' through the door
You, and your mans, and them just took over the floor
Started doing your thing
And it made me notice you even more
The way you turned around and looked at me seemed as though
You must've somehow felt me staring on the low
Something tells me you're the kind of guy I'd like to get to know

[Chorus]
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club

We can dance if you want
Get it crackin' if you like

Feel like one of those nights

Why is this the first time that I'm seeing you around?
Could you be visiting, or are you new in town?
Yeah, whatever the case
I'm feeling you right here and right now
Your smile and all the love you showing lets me know that you
Like what you see and wanna get to know me too
This could very well be the start of something special
Happy that I met you

I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club

A new day has come
A new day has come

[Verse 1]
I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear
Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (Drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun

A new day has come
A new day has come
Come

Where there was pain, now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength

Oh, it's almost blinding me

Turn Off the Light Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say, "Woe is me," instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me, "You're better off alone"

[Pre-Chorus]
But after midnight
Morning will come
And the day will see
If you will get some
[Chorus]
They say, "That girl, ya know, she act too tough, tough, tough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say, "That girl, you know, she act so rough, rough, rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say, "Follow me, follow me, follow me down
Down, down, down
'Til you see all my dreams"
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems

[Verse 2]
I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon (By the moon)
If it's high, play it low
If it's harvest, go slow
And if it's full, then go

[Pre-Chorus]
But after midnight
Morning will come
And the day will see
If you're gonna get some

[Chorus]
They say, "That girl, ya know, she act too tough, tough, tough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say, "That girl, you know, she act so rough, rough, rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light

Living and Living Well Lyrics[Verse 1]
Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

[Chorus]
There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well
[Verse 2]
Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you

My List Lyrics[Verse 1]
Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store
Put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

[Chorus]
Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list
[Verse 2]
Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today...

[Chorus]
Like go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

[Chorus 2]
Raise a little hell, laugh 'till it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start living', that's the next thing on my list

Hands Clean Lyrics[Verse 1]
If it weren't for your maturity, none of this would've happened
If you weren't so wise beyond your years, I would've been able to control myself
If it weren't for my attention, you wouldn't have been successful, and if
If it weren't for me, you would never have amounted to very much

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could be messy
But, but you don't seem to mind, and
Ooh, don't go telling everybody, and
And overlook this supposed crime
[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I have honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

[Verse 2]
You're essentially an employee and I like you having to depend on me
You're a kind of protégé, and one day, you'll say you learned all you know from me, and
And I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would, and I think I like ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, this could get messy
But, ooh, you don't seem to mind
Dude, don't go telling everybody
And overlook this supposed crime

[Chorus]
We'll fast forward to a few years later
And no one knows except the both of us
And I've more than honored your request for silence
And you've washed your hands clean of this

What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance, it seems so obvious?

TranslationsPortuguêsSk8er Boi Lyrics[Verse 1]
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

[Chorus]
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to Earth
[Verse 2]
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feedin' the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

[Chorus]
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a skater boy, she said, "See you later, boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends

Long Time Gone Lyrics[Verse 1]
Daddy sits on a front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My Brothers found work in Indiana
M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I’ve been a long time gone

[Chorus]
Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again
[Verse 2]
Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone

[Chorus]
Been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again

Now me, I went to Nashville
Tryin' to beat the big deal

They got Junior but they don't have Hank

Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?
[Chorus]
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

[Verse 2]
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

You feel good, right?

I kinda noticed somethin' wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kinda weird to me since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song with me

Can't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing? (Thing, thing)
They say so and so was datin'
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

Ma, whatchu wanna do? I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see? I can have fun with two

Point to her, they say, "Wow, it's the same glow"
Point to me, I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my a-like (Yeah)
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride with me, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called "Brain" (I just love your, brain)

I Do!! Lyrics[Verse 1]
He was a six-foot stallion
Say, a storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder
How he put down the love
He had a hanky in his pocket
A phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpitatin'
Every time he came near (I do!!)
He got a spankin' new Range
For that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin'
He was plaided
And his hair was cornrowed
He had his wrists bling-blingin'
And his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me
But I knew he had me at go
[Chorus]
I do!!
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
'Cause I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control

[Verse 2]
Me and my crew started groovin'
Made our way to the floor
It's time to activate my plan
And give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip
And rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me
I felt fingertips (I do!!)
On the small of my back
So I had to react
Like I was playin' hard to get
And told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes
All I could see was his soul
I'm 'bout to make this guy my man
That I can tell you for sure

Watch me drop, drop
Shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips
As I dip and roll
And watch me stop, stop traffic
As I walk through the room
Knowin' all the papis want me
But all I want is you (I do!!)
Watch me drop, drop
Shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips
As I dip and roll
And watch me stop, stop traffic
As I walk through the room
Knowin' all the papis want me
But all I want is you
