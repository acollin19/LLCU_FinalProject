TranslationsTürkçeSomebody That I Used to Know Lyrics[Verse 1: Gotye]
Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)
And I don't even need your love (Ooh)
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (Ah)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)
I guess that I don't need that though (Ooh)

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

We Are Young Lyrics[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Where are the plans we made for two?

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it

Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot

If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping
Music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jump and don't stop
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van, mic check one two
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, a hundred super models
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh
Party rocker, fa-show stopper, more shampoo
Number one, club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Oh, it's on like everything goes, round up baby til the freaky show
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like em untamed, don't tell me hide pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder when we hit fame
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh
I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and lets begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough
I hear you like the wild stuff
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Some Nights Lyrics[Chorus]
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh-woah) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh-woah) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

[Refrain]
Oh-woah, oh-ooh-woah-oh

This is it, boys, this is war
(Oh-woah, oh-ooh-woah-oh)
What are we waiting for?
(Oh-ooh-woah-oh, oh-oh)
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh-woah, oh-ooh-woah-oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh-woah-oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard, and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who I, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm, mmm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh-woah-oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh-woah-oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

[Bridge]
(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No, when I see stars, when I s-
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So come on, oh, come on, oh, come on
Oh, come on
[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
(Oh-woah, oh-ooh-woah-oh)
Five minutes in, and I'm bored again
(Oh-ooh-woah-oh, oh-oh)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
(Oh-woah, oh-ooh-woah-oh)
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
(Oh-ooh-woah-oh, oh-oh)
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called "love"
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love

TranslationsPortuguêsEnglishTake Care Lyrics[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt

Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication

Blow Me (One Last Kiss) Lyrics[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I'll dress nice, I'll look good

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay

Ass Back Home Lyrics[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Oh, it's so sexy, yo

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie, Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)

Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck, 'cause they be swallowin' it

Or when you're coming home (Alright)

Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

Wanna kiss your lips

And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever

A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious

Springsteen Lyrics[Verse 1]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' "don't go"

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky

Brokenhearted Lyrics[Intro: Amy Heidemann]
Oh, yeah
Uh, c'mon, yeah

[Verse 1: Amy Heidemann]
This is more than the typical kinda thing
Felt a jones in my bones when you were touching me
Uh-oh, didn't wanna take it slow
In a daze, goin' craze, I can barely think
You're replayin' in my brain, find it hard to sleep
Uh-oh, waitin' for my phone to blow

[Pre-Chorus: Amy Heidemann]
Uh-oh, yup
Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a bit of trouble, yup, and now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
I don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour
Uh-oh, I can't seem to let you go

[Chorus: Amy Heidemann]
See, I've been waitin' all day
For you to call me, baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest, baby, I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it, so come and get it

Not Over You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

[Bridge]
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

Stereo Hearts Lyrics[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop ([?])
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)
[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

Or is it just a one-night stand?”

Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range

Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice

But I'm guessin' that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missin' me
You've been tellin' people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours? (Bless your soul)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me and, boy, you're bringin' me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core

Good Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
With your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you what you’re thinking about
You'll see a good boy (You'll see a good boy)
Gonna give you the world
But he’s gonna leave you crying with your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey, but he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and go and throw away the key
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
Get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

[Chorus]
Why, why you gotta be so blind?
Won't you open up your eyes?
Just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl
No good for you
You better get to gettin' on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go
Better listen to me, he’s low, low, low

[Verse 2]
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)
You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl (Just like you should, girl)
Like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever
Well, it don’t mean much
Hey, good girl (Hey, good girl)

Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque

Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

[Chorus]
Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away (Blown away)

[Verse 2]
She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screamin' of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Oh woah, oh woah

[Verse 1]
We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing, even here inside these walls
Breaking each others hearts and we don’t care 'cause we’re so

[Chorus]
In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 2]
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way
You might also like[Chorus]
In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Bridge]
And it hurts 'cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around, even though I fell way

[Chorus]
In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had22Embed

Drank In My Cup Lyrics[Intro]
Kirko, uh (Bangz)
I done came down, hold up
Sound M.O.B

[Verse 1]
I done came down, hold up
Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin' to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, East up
Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mind bomb
Only if you got that zip tight
Eat that shit like wonton

So Good Lyrics[Verse 1]
Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

[Post-Chorus]

Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile

50 Ways to Say Goodbye Lyrics[Verse 1]
My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

[Pre-Chorus]
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

[Chorus 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Verse 2]
My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

Red Solo Cup LyricsHey, one, two, three

[Verse 1]
Now, red Solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass
Whoo!

[Chorus]
Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

[Verse 2]
Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hitting
On them to help me get lucky

5 O’Clock Lyrics[Chorus: Lily Allen & T-Pain]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (Ugh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (Ugh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (Ugh)
And I was hoping you would— (Ayy)

[Verse 1: T-Pain, Lily Allen, & Both]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it, 'cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
The Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause you be sending me texts-es
Like, "Boy, just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love"
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time, she—
Might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (Ah-ah-ah)
And then ask me kindly— (Ah-ah-ah)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song

And I was hoping you would creep in (Goodnight)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning

You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head, like
"What is he doing?" (Oh) "What is he doing?"
'Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
And you texting me, like, "I'ma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?"
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh (Ooh)
Well, my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me tripping, and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (Worry 'bout nothing)
Girl, I got you (I got you), girl I got you
She might come and find me-ee (Nah-nah-nah)
And then ask me kindly-y (Oh, no, no)
Do I want her to go crazy? (Crazy) We do this every night

And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa, Lily Allen, & T-Pain]
Oh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on
But the T-shirt that I left over your house the last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home, waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib—
(It’s 5 o' clock in the morning) And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night, and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less 'cause I’m sure you’re the best, you’re the one
So I let you—that's how you show me love
And when we finished, you like, “Damn, babe, you woke me up” (Whoa, oh)
I like you way you put it down, like it's for both of us (Oh, oh)
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up (Oh, yeah)
[Chorus: T-Pain & Lily Allen; Wiz Khalifa]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Hahahahaha)
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in
It's 5 o' clock in the morning25Embed

TranslationsΕλληνικάA Thousand Years Lyrics[Verse 1]
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave?
How can I love when I'm
Afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt
Suddenly goes away somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
For a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Verse 2]
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything
Take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this

Take A Little Ride Lyrics[Verse 1]
Been going 'round and 'round all day
Bailing some hay and stackin' it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the Quick Stop
Grab a couple rocky tops
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock

[Chorus]
Well, I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean the seat back
Man, I swear there ain't nothin' looks better than that
Sweet tan little thing with nothin' to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

[Verse 2]
I hope you're wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby, that's a good night
Anyone from the heartland is gonna understand
What I am talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top

I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

And I am left to sell

But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin

To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

And all I know now is it's going good

Fly Over States Lyrics[Verse 1]
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma

Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?

They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

Even If It Breaks Your Heart Lyrics[Verse 1]

The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"

[Verse 3]
Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure

TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsBURN IT DOWN Lyrics[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground57Embed
